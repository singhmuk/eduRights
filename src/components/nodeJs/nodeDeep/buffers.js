                  Pure JavaScript is Unicode friendly, but it is not so for
                  binary data. While dealing with TCP streams or the file
                  system, it's necessary to handle octet streams. Node provides
                  Buffer class which help to store raw data to a raw memory
                  allocation outside the V8 heap.

              <h3>Buffering process output</h3>
              <p>
                In cases where the complete buffered output of a child process
                is sufficient, with no need to manage data through events,
                child_process offers the exec method. The method takes three
                arguments:{" "}
              </p>
              command: A command-line string. Unlike spawn and fork, which pass
              arguments to a command via an array, this first argument accepts a
              full command string, such as ps aux | grep node.
              <br />
              <br />
              <ul>
                <b>options: This is an optional argument.</b>
                <li>
                  cwd (String): This sets the working directory for the command
                  process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  env (Object): This is a map of key-value pairs that will be
                  exposed to the child process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  encoding (String): This is the encoding of the child's data
                  stream. The default value is 'utf8'.
                </li>
                <li>
                  timeout (Number): This specifies the milliseconds to wait for
                  the process to complete, at which point the child process will
                  be sent the killSignal.maxBuffer value.
                </li>
                <li>
                  killSignal.maxBuffer (Number): This is the maximum number of
                  bytes allowed on stdout or stderr. When this number is
                  exceeded, the process is killed. This default is 200 KB.
                </li>
                <li>
                  killSignal (String): The child process receives this signal
                  after a timeout. This default is SIGTERM.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              When you want the buffering behavior of exec but are targeting a
              Node file, use execFile. Importantly, execFile does not spawn a
              new subshell, which makes it slightly less expensive to run.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Create Buffer</b>
              <p>
                If we store data in memory that we receive, then create a new
                buffer. In Node.js we use the alloc().
              </p>
              <p>
                The alloc() function takes the size of the buffer as its first
                and only required argument. The size is an integer representing
                how many bytes of memory the buffer object will use.
              </p>

              <b>2 Ways to create buffer</b>
              <p>
                Create a buffer from data that already exists, like a string or
                array.
              </p>
              To create a buffer from pre-existing data, we use the from()
              method. We can use that function to create buffers from:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>An array of integers :</b> The integer values can be
                  between 0 and 255.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>An ArrayBuffer :</b> This is a JavaScript object that
                  stores a fixed length of bytes.
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>A string</li>
                  <li>Another buffer</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>

              <br />
              <b>Reading from buffer</b>
              <p>
                To access one byte of a buffer, we pass the index or location of
                the byte we want. Buffers store data sequentially like arrays.
              </p>

                  <li>
                    Buffer can only accept an integer value. We can’t assign it
                    to the letter.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If try to write more bytes than a buffer’s size, the buffer
                    object will only accept what bytes fit.

              <h3>How can you handle errors in a Node.js application?</h3>
              Handling errors in a Node.js application is essential for ensuring
              that the application runs smoothly and without any unexpected
              errors or crashes.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Use try-catch blocks: </b>Wrap code that might throw errors
                  in try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully. If an error
                  is thrown, the catch block will handle the error and take
                  appropriate action.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>Use error events: </b>Node.js provides built-in error
                  events that can be used to handle errors in the application.
                  These events can be used to catch unhandled errors that are
                  not caught by try-catch blocks.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>Use error handling middleware: </b>In an Express.js
                  application, error handling middleware can be used to catch
                  and handle errors that occur during the request-response
                  cycle.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>Use logging: </b>Logging errors can be helpful in
                  identifying the root cause of errors and fixing them. Use a
                  logging library like Winston or Bunyan to log errors in the
                  application.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>Use domain: </b>The domain module in Node.js can be used to
                  handle errors that occur in asynchronous code. A domain can be
                  created to handle errors in a specific part of the
                  application.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>Use error codes: </b>Use error codes to identify specific
                  errors in the application. Error codes can help developers
                  quickly identify the cause of errors and take appropriate
                  action to fix them.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>Use fallbacks: </b>If an error occurs, it's important to
                  provide a fallback mechanism to ensure that the application
                  continues to function as expected. For example, if a database
                  connection fails, the application should provide a fallback
                  mechanism to ensure that data is retrieved from another
                  source.

              <h3>How do you implement caching in Node.js?</h3>
              Caching is an important technique for improving the performance of
              a Node.js application. Here are some ways to implement caching in
              Node.js:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>In-memory caching: </b>In-memory caching is the simplest
                  caching technique, where data is stored in the server's
                  memory. You can use the node-cache or memory-cache modules for
                  implementing in-memory caching in Node.js.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>Redis caching: </b>Redis is an in-memory data store that
                  can be used as a caching solution. You can use the redis
                  module to connect to a Redis server and implement caching.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>Browser caching: </b>Browser caching is a technique that
                  stores frequently accessed files such as CSS, JavaScript, and
                  images in the browser's cache. You can set the cache-control
                  header to control how long the browser should cache the files.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>CDN caching: </b>CDN caching is a technique that caches
                  content on a distributed network of servers. You can use a CDN
                  service like Cloudflare or Akamai to implement CDN caching.
                </li>
                <br />
                When implementing caching, it's important to choose the
                appropriate caching strategy based on the specific requirements
                of your application. You should also configure cache expiration
                and invalidation policies to ensure that cached data remains
                consistent with the latest data in the database.
              </ul>

              <h3>How do you handle concurrency and parallelism in Node.js?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Event-driven programming: </b> Node.js is based on an
                  event-driven programming model where I/O operations are
                  performed asynchronously. This means that Node.js can handle
                  multiple I/O operations concurrently without blocking the main
                  thread.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>Callbacks: </b>Node.js uses callbacks to handle
                  asynchronous operations. You can use callbacks to execute
                  multiple functions in parallel.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>Promises: </b>Promises are a cleaner way to handle
                  asynchronous operations than callbacks. You can use promises
                  to execute multiple functions in parallel and handle their
                  results using then() and catch() methods.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>Async/await: </b>Async/await is a modern syntax for
                  handling asynchronous operations in Node.js. You can use the
                  async keyword to mark a function as asynchronous and the await
                  keyword to wait for the completion of an asynchronous
                  operation.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <b>Cluster module: </b>Node.js provides a built-in cluster
                  module that allows you to create a cluster of Node.js
                  processes to handle multiple requests concurrently. The
                  cluster module creates child processes that can handle
                  incoming requests and distribute the load across multiple CPU
                  cores.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Use a memory profiler: </b> A memory profiler can help
                  identify memory leaks by showing which objects are taking up
                  the most memory. Some popular memory profiling tools for

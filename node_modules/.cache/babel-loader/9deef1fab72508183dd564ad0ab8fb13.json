Data Distribution</h3>\n              To create big data sets for testing, we use NumPy, which comes with a number of methods to create\n              random data sets, of any size.\n              <ul>\n                <li><b>Histogram: </b> To visualize the data set we can draw a histogram with the data we collected.</li>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>Histogram is frequency distribussion</li>\n                </ul>\n                <li><b>Scatter: </b> Plot a diagram where each value in the data set is represented by a dot.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>6. Scale</h3>\n              When data has different values, and even different measurement units, it can be difficult to compare them. What\n              is kilograms compared to meters? Or altitude compared to time? We can scale data into new values that are easier to compare.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>8. Explain the terms AI, ML and Deep Learning</h3>\n              AI is the domain of producing intelligent machines. ML refers to systems that\n              can assimilate from experience (training data) and DL states to systems that learn from\n              experience on large data sets. ML can be considered as a subset of AI. DL is ML but\n              useful to large data sets.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <b>In summary, DL is a subset of ML & both were the subsets of AI.</b>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>9. What are the different types of Learning/ Training models in ML?</h3>\n              ML algorithms can be primarily classified depending on the presence/ absence of target variables.\n              <br />\n              <b>1. Supervised learning: (Target is present)</b>\n              <ul>\n                <li>The machine learns using labelled data. The model is trained on an existing data set before it starts making decisions with the new data.</li>\n                <li><b>Target variable is continuous: </b>Linear Regression, polynomial Regression, quadratic Regression.</li>\n                <li><b>Target variable is categorical: </b>Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, ADA boosting, Bagging, Random forest etc.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <b>2. Unsupervised learning: (Target is absent)</b>\n              <br />\n              The machine is trained on unlabelled data and without any proper guidance. It automatically infers\n              patterns and relationships in the data by creating clusters. The model learns through observations and\n              deduced structures in the data.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <b>3. Reinforcement Learning:</b>\n              The model learns through a trial and error method. This kind of learning involves an agent that will interact\n              with the environment to create actions and then discover errors/ rewards of that action.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>10. What is the difference between deep learning and machine learning?</h3>\n              ML involves algorithms that learn from patterns of data and then apply it to decision making. DL is able to learn through processing\n              data on its own and is quite similar to the human brain where it identifies something, analyse it, and makes a decision.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <b>The key differences are as follow:</b>\n              <ul>\n                <li>The manner in which data is presented to the system.</li>\n                <li>ML algorithms always require structured data and deep learning networks rely on layers of artificial neural networks.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>11. How do you select important variables while working on a data set? </h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Identify and discard correlated variables before finalizing on important variables.</li>\n                <li>The variables could be selected based on ‘p’ values from Linear Regression.</li>\n                <li>Forward, Backward, and Stepwise selection.</li>\n                <li>Lasso Regression.</li>\n                <li>Random Forest and plot variable chart.</li>\n                <li>Top features can be selected based on information gain for the available set of features.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>12. There are many ML algorithms till now. If given a data set, how can one determine which algorithm to be used for that?</h3>\n              ML algorithm to be used purely depends on the type of data in a given dataset. If data is linear then,\n              we use linear regression. If data shows non-linearity then, the bagging algorithm would do better. If\n              the data is to be analyzed/ interpreted for some business purposes then we can use decision trees or SVM.\n              If the dataset consists of images, videos, audios then, neural networks would be helpful to get the\n              solution accurately.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              So, there is no certain metric to decide which algorithm to be used for a given situation.\n              We need to explore the data using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and understand the purpose of using the\n              dataset to come up with the best fit algorithm.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <img src={ScatterPlot} alt=\"ScatterPlot\" className=\"responsive\" style={redesign} />\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>13.

We look at ML s/w almost all the time. How do we apply ML to Hardware.</h3>\n              We have to build ML algorithms in System Verilog which is a Hardware development Language and then\n              program it onto an <b>FPGA</b> to apply ML to hardware.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>16. When does regularization come into play in ML.</h3>\n              At times when the model begins to underfit/ overfit, regularization becomes necessary. It is a\n              regression that diverts/ regularizes the coefficient estimates towards zero. It reduces flexibility\n              and discourages learning in a model to avoid the risk of overfitting. The model complexity is reduced\n              and it becomes better at predicting.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>17. A data set is given to you and it has missing values which spread along 1standard deviation from the mean. How much of the data would remain untouched.</h3>\n              The data is spread across mean so data is spread across an average. So, we can presume that it is a normal distribution.\n              <br />\n              In a normal distribution, about 68% of data lies in 1standard deviation from averages like mean, mode or median. So, about 32% of the\n              data remains uninfluenced by missing values.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>18. A data set is given to you about utilities fraud detection.

If not, what can you do about it.</h3>\n              Data set about utilities fraud detection is not balanced enough i.e. imbalanced. In such a data set, accuracy score cannot be the measure\n              of performance as it may only be predict the majority class label correctly but in this case our point of interest is to predict the minority\n              label. But often minorities are treated as noise and ignored. So, there is a high probability of misclassification of the minority label as\n              compared to the majority label.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              For evaluating the model performance in case of imbalanced data sets, we should use Sensitivity\n              (True Positive rate) or Specificity (True Negative rate) to determine class label wise performance of the classification model. If the minority\n              class label’s performance is not so good, we could do the following:\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <ul>\n                <li>We can use under sampling/ over sampling to balance the data.</li>\n                <li>We can change the prediction threshold value.</li>\n                <li>We can assign weights to labels such that the minority class labels get larger weights.</li>\n                <li>We could detect anomalies.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>19.

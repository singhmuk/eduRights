Asymptotic notation is a mathematical tool that is used to represent\n              the time complexity of algorithms for asymptotic analysis.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              The three most used asymptotic notation is as follows.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <b>θ Notation:</b><br />\n              θ Notation defines exact asymptotic behavior.

The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n2).\n              It is useful when we only have upper bound on time complexity of an algorithm.\n              <br />\n              <img src={Big_O} alt=\"Big O\" className=\"responsive\" style={redesign} />\n              <br />\n              <br />\n\n              <b>Ω Notation:</b><br />\n              Just like Big O notation provides an asymptotic upper bound, the Ω Notation provides an\n              asymptotic lower bound on a function.

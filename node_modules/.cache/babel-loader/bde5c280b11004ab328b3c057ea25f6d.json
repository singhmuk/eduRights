When the size of an index exceeds the amount of\n                available RAM on a server, MongoDB may not be able to keep the\n                entire index in memory. This can result in slower query\n                performance, as MongoDB must read the index from disk rather\n                than from memory.\n              </p>\n              In situations where the index is too large to fit in memory, there\n              are several strategies that can be used to improve performance:\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  <b>Add more RAM to the server: </b>This is the simplest\n                  solution and can often improve performance significantly.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  <b>Use a more efficient index: </b>If possible, consider using\n                  a smaller or more efficient index that can fit in memory.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  <b>Sharding: </b>MongoDB supports sharding, which allows data\n                  to be distributed across multiple servers.

This ensures that\n                  subsequent read operations will see the updated data, even if\n                  the primary node fails and a new primary is elected.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  In addition, MongoDB supports multi-document transactions,\n                  which ensures that a group of operations are executed as a\n                  single atomic unit. This guarantees consistency across\n                  multiple documents in a collection and can be used to\n                  implement complex business logic.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  MongoDB also provides a number of features such as read and\n                  write concerns, causal consistency, and retryable writes,\n                  which enable developers to fine-tune consistency requirements\n                  based on their specific use cases.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <h3>5.

Why MongoDB is not preferred over a 32-bit system?</h3>\n              <p>\n                MongoDB is not preferred over a 32-bit system because MongoDB\n                uses memory-mapped files for performance reasons, and 32-bit\n                systems have a limited address space, which can lead to problems\n                when working with large data sets. In a 32-bit system, MongoDB\n                can only use up to 4GB of RAM, which is a very small amount for\n                modern databases. This can cause the database to slow down or\n                even crash when working with large amounts of data. Therefore,\n                it is recommended to use a 64-bit system for running MongoDB in\n                order to take advantage of larger address spaces and avoid these\n                limitations.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <h3>\n                16.

The main purpose of replication is to ensure that\n                data is always available, even in the event of hardware failure,\n                network outages, or other issues that could affect the\n                availability of a MongoDB instance.\n              </p>\n              MongoDB uses a primary-secondary replication model, also known as\n              master-slave replication. In this model, there is one primary node\n              that handles all write operations and multiple secondary nodes\n              that replicate data from the primary node. The primary node is\n              responsible for accepting all write operations and applying them\n              to its own database. The secondary nodes copy the data from the\n              primary node and apply the same operations to their own databases.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <b>Replication in MongoDB provides several benefits:</b>\n              <br />\n              <p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>\n                    <b>High availability: </b>With multiple copies of the data,\n                    the system is always available, even in the event of\n                    hardware or network failures.\n                  </li>\n                  <br />\n                  <li>\n                    <b>Fault tolerance: </b>If the primary node fails, one of\n                    the secondary nodes can be promoted to take over as the new\n                    primary.\n                  </li>\n                  <br />\n                  <li>\n                    <b>Scalability: </b>Replication allows for horizontal\n                    scaling by adding more secondary nodes to the system.\n                  </li>\n                  <br />\n                  <li>\n                    <b>Data durability: </b>Because data is stored in multiple\n                    locations, replication provides an extra layer of protection\n                    against data loss.\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <b>How Replication Works in MongoDB : </b>\n              <br />\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  MongoDB achieves replication by the use of replica set. A\n                  replica set is a group of mongod instances that host the same\n                  data set. In a replica, one node is primary node that receives\n                  all write operations. All other instances, such as\n                  secondaries, apply operations from the primary so that they\n                  have the same data set. Replica set can have only one primary\n                  node. Replica set is a group of two or more nodes (generally\n                  minimum 3 nodes are required).\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  In a replica set, one node is primary node and remaining nodes\n                  are secondary. At the time of automatic failover or\n                  maintenance, election establishes for primary and a new\n                  primary node is elected. After the recovery of failed node, it\n                  again join the replica set and works as a secondary node.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <b>Replica Set Features : </b>\n                <br />\n                <ul>\n                  <li>A cluster of N nodes </li>\n                  <li>Any one node can be primary</li>\n                  <li>All write operations go to primary</li>\n                  <li>Automatic failover </li>\n                  <li>Automatic recovery</li>\n                </ul>\n                <br />\n                <b>Consensus election of primary Set Up a Replica Set :</b>\n                <p>\n                  Sharding: Sharding is the process of storing data records\n                  across multiple machines and it is MongoDB's approach to\n                  meeting the demands of data growth. As the size of the data\n                  increases, a single machine may not be sufficient to store the\n                  data nor provide an acceptable read and write throughput.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Sharding solves the problem with horizontal scaling.

To limit this, you\n                need to set a list of fields with value 1 or 0. 1 is used to\n                show the field while 0 is used to hide the fields.\n              </p>\n              <h3>27.

Capped collections restrict updates to the documents\n                  if the update results in increased document size. Since capped\n                  collections store documents in the order of the disk storage,\n                  it ensures that the document size does not increase the size\n                  allocated on the disk. Capped collections are best for storing\n                  log information, cache data, or any other high volume data.{\" \"}\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={code}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <i>\n                This will create a collection named student, with maximum size\n                of 5 megabytes and maximum of 5000 documents.\n              </i>\n              <br />\n              <h3>28. What is mongodb indexing</h3>\n              MongoDB uses indexing in order to make the query processing more\n              efficient. If there is no indexing, then the MongoDB must scan\n              every document in the collection and retrieve only those documents\n              that match the query. Indexes are special data structures that\n              stores some information related to the documents such that it\n              becomes easy for MongoDB to find the right data file. The indexes\n              are order by the value of the field specified in the index.\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={createInd}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <br />\n              <h3>29.

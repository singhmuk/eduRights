both classification as well as regression. But\n              however, it is mainly used for classification problems. As we know that a forest is made up of trees and more trees\n              means more robust forest. Similarly, random forest algorithm creates decision trees on data samples and then gets the\n              prediction from each of them and finally selects the best solution by means of voting. It is an ensemble method which\n              is better than a single decision tree because it reduces the over-fitting by averaging the result. Working of Random\n              Forest Algorithm.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <ul>\n                <li>1. Start with the selection of random samples from a given dataset. </li>\n                <li>2. This algorithm will construct a decision tree for every sample. Then it will get the prediction result from\n                  every decision tree.</li>\n                <li>3. Voting will be performed for every predicted result.</li>\n                <li>4. At last, select the most voted prediction result as the final prediction result.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <b>Pros: </b>\n              <ul>\n                <li>It overcomes the problem of overfitting by averaging or combining the results of different decision trees.</li>\n                <li>Work well for a large range of data items than a single decision tree does. Random forest has less variance then single decision tree.</li>\n                <li>Very flexible and possess very high accuracy.</li>\n                <li>Scaling of data does not require in random forest algorithm.

More computational resources\n                  are required to implement Random Forest algorithm.</li>\n                <li>It is less intuitive in case when we have a large collection of decision trees.

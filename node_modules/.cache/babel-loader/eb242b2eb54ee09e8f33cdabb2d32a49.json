Don't make excuses. Make it a commitment as somebody said when you are interested in something. You do it when you like, When you are commited to something you do whether you like or you don't like. One traveler writes in his book, he was traveling in Africa and he came across a cannibal tribe. These cannibals, they eat humans. He was astonished that, one of the tribes men had been educated in America. He said after American english education. You still eat human flesh, then what is the difference. That cannibal said, \\\"The difference is earlier i used to eat it with my fingers, now i eat it with knife and fork\\\". That's not much of a difference, is it? What does it count for? It's so easy for our mond to make excuses. You know, I could not do it because the bord went over the head. There's an inspiring story about awareness from the japanese tradition. There has been a great sword fencer called Ram. His father was also a great sword fencer, but his father trained the other sons and he gave up on this guy that you are no good. Nevertheless, Ram went to another the greatest swordman of the land and he said, \\\"Will you teach me this?\\\" That master said, \\\"I will, but you will do exactly as i say, and you will not use your intellect.\\\" Ram said, \\\"All right.\\\" Start cleaning the vessels of the monastery. Ram Started cleaning the vessels. Then he had to cook, and then he had to clean the room, and get the water from the rivet. And this went on and on and on. One year went by, second year went by. He Started getting disappointed. There is no talking as well of the sword fencing i had come to learn it and there is no question about it. I only clean vessels and take care of the house. A third year went by. Finally, that master, he came from behind one day Ram was cleaning a vessel he wacked him. Ahh! He said, \\\"Be careful. Henceforth I can come and hit you at any time. He said all right. Now he Started developing his awareness and this master would come and whack him at any time. Slowly, slowly he Started getting more and more alert until he would be able to gaze and judge and dodge. Until his awareness developed even more when the merest whiff, and he would turn around and probably catch the stick or something. The master said, \\\"Now you are ready. Now i will teach you sword fencing.\\\" So it's a question of being completely aware. Don't make excuses. He is pretty stricy. He says irrespective of time, place, circumstance make it like a universal vow. Make it a commitment. When you are interested in something, You do it when you like. When you are commitment to something, you do it whether you like or you don't like. That's the kind of commitment he is demanding. Don't make compromises. This will require tremendous awareness. You know the opposite of awareness is carelessness. The devotees have their own way of being aware. Be aware of the presence of God. Maharajji says 'Be aware that God and Guru are with you and watching you all the time.' This kind of carelessness require a great motivation and a great dedication. You need to have complete lack of carelessness and complete application to the task. This will come, when you have a strong why. A strong reason motivating you. And the biggest reason motivating us is that the human form is a golden chance for the salvation of the soul. If we don't utilize it, we will go back. 'Aji sahab, you are a human being in this life what are you going to become in your next life?'. 'Ji, I am going to become a dhobi ka gadha.' My God! After the human being you're becoming a dhobi ka gadha? You've gone that down? Yes, I did not utilize the chance i had. The oppertunity is tremendous, but the time span is limited. And that time is slipping out of our hands. You know, like you lift up sand on the beach and you find it is slipping out until nothing is left so also is human life. We think I've got so many years, but without realizing it one by one the years go by. It was only a few years ago that you passed out of collage. It was only a few more years before that you enered school as a little child. How quickly the time has gone by. How quickly 2020 went by. Half of 2022 has also disappeared and it's never going to come back. Did we make the best use of it? One moment that we wasted is one moment lost forever. Mahatma said, What is the biggest loss in life? That moment which you don't utilize in remembering Shri Krishna. And why don't we utilize? Carelessness We know what we are supposed to do, but we don't do it because of carelessness. That carelessness makes us waste, squander the oppertunity. That is why to implement this we need to motivate ourselves. You see, when the motivation is there, the most challenging thing becomes easy and when the motivation is not there, the smallest difficulty seems like an unassailable wall. This motivation has to come, in other words, a deep hunger. Guru has said three special graces of God. The first is the human form. Everybody here has got that grace. The second is the guidance of the saints. That also we have got. The third is hunger. Hunger for the Ultimate Goal. You all have got it to a certain extent, that's why your have come here. But that one grace needs to be enhanced. In other word, the hunger has to be deepened. The deeper the hunger, the harder we shall endeavor the more careful we will be.\", React.createElement(\"br\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 103\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }), React.createElement(\"br\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 104\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }), React.createElement(\"h3\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 106\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, \"2.3 UNTOLD Powers of a 100% Focussed Mind.\"), \"The goal of life is to attain the Supreme Lord. This can only happen when our mind attains complete and absolute absorption in the divine. And that can be done by developing the ability for concentration. Razor sharp focus is one of the most powerful mental faculties that we can possess. Take a look at the power of laser beams. They are energized by a few watts of energy and they contain just light rays. But because of the intensity of the focus, they are used for drilling holes in diamonds that are amongst the hardest things on this planet. In contrast, is the sun. It emits billions of kilowatts of light energy to the earth every minute. And yet you can conveniently walk under the sunlight with a light umbrella on your head without getting burnt. So what is the difference b/w ordinary sunlight and laser beams? It lies in the intensity of the focus. Likewise, is the focus in stream engines. Now, water vapor evaporates in hundreds of tons from lakes, stream, seas and oceans. It does not burn anyone, but the water vapor when it is focused in the piston of the stream engine, and brought to bear with intensity in that railway engine it empowers it to pull thousands of tons of steel and iron at hurtling speeds on those railway tracks. That is the power of focus. Similarly, if we can develop mental focus, we can bring intensity to any physical or intellectual work that we perform. Focus declutter our mind. If you have had the experience of driving a car in a rain-storm, you will be aware how it blurs up vision. That is way cars come with the feature of vipers for retaining clarity. Likewise, to make good decision in life. we need to declutter our mind from the distraction all around us. And that can be done by developingvthe ability for concentration. Just as an artist did  in the time of Mahant. This great sage went from Dakshineswar to Kplkata to participate in the ratha yatra if Lord Jagarnath. He reached late and the chariot had passed by. He asked a shopkeeper, \\\"Has the ratha of Lord Jagarnath gone by from here?\\\" The shopkeeper was a painter. He said, \\\"No, not yet.\\\" The neighboring shopkeeper corrected him. \\\"Why are you telling lies to such a big Mahatma? It went by a couple of hours ago.\\\" The pinter said, \\\"I never saw it.\\\" His neibhbor said, \\\"Never mind, you must have heard the jkankj, the manjira, the mridangasm the drums?\\\" The painter said, \\\"I never heard anything.\\\" Mahatma was astonished. He sat there in meditation and realizd this painter is telling the truth. He came out of his meditation and touched his feet and said, \\\"The world calls me a mahatma, but your mind is so incredibly focused you were so absorbed in your painting that the whole procession went by with hundreds of people and you did not come to know.\\\" That is how focus declutters our mind, and it enhances our ability to understand. So for example, when you sit in a class listening to a talk or a lecture, the more you focus, the better is your comprehension. And if the focus is diffused, the mind wanders away. Your ability to understand also gets affected. Try this experiment early in the morning when you wake up, use that first one hour tolearn some new subject. You will discover your brain is working like sponge and it has 400% efficiency compared to doing the same activity in the evening when the mind is cluttered by the daily exposure. So that is how focus enhances our ability to understand. Focus is also necessary for learning new skills. These require bringing our mental and intellectual abilities to bear upon mastering an art. Sunil Gavaskar one of the greatest batsmen in the world ever, the one who broke Bradman's record for the maximum number of Test centuries which stood at 29. Sunil Gavaskar scored 34 Test centuries and his record was subsequently broken again, but he was asked What iis the secret of your virtuoso batting? He said, \\\"My ability to focus. I keep my eyes on the ball.\\\" Focus also helps us enhance our mental state. Usually we let thoughts happens to us as reactions to events in the environment. But when we have focus, we can then choose the feelings that we wish to harbor. And this frees us, us from the clutches of the mind. We feel better about ourselves and can take charge of our life. And finally, focus can help us attain God. Let's read about it from my latest book, The goal of life is to attain the Supreme Lord. This can only happen when our mind attains complete and absolute absorption in the divine. The Gita states, just as a lamp in a windless place does not flicker, so the disciplined mind of a yogi remains steady in meditation on the Supreme. When the mind restrained from material activities becomes still in the practice of Uog, then the yogi is able to behold the soul through the purified mind, and he rejoices in inner joy. In that joyous state of yog called Samadhi, one experiences supreme, boundless, divine bliss. And thus situated one never deviates from the eternal truth. Gita says Despite the benefits of focus, we find that we are besieged by absent mindedness. We suffer from the shattered focus syndrome. Our mind has this propensity, this novelty bias, and therefore we'll have to work hard to enhance our concentration. We learn how to do that in the next couple of weeks.\", React.createElement(\"br\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 156\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }), React.createElement(\"br\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 157\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }), React.createElement(\"h3\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 159\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, \"3. Control your Mind in 21 Days - How it Works.\"), \"This mind of ours, If it is controlled it will become our best friend. Lift ourself by the power of our mind. Do not degrade ourself. The mind is a place of its own and in itself can make Heaven out of Hell or Hell out of Heaven. These were the words of John Milton, a weatern philosopher. And how true they are! We may possess Money, Fame, Poweb yet, If we have not learnt to Master our Mind. We will not experience the Happiness and fulfillment That we are searching for in our life. Consider the example of one of the richest persons in history, Howard. He had so much of wealth! Amongst his many businesses, he became a film producer in Hollywood, and developed a reputation for being a playboy who went out with many famous heroines. However, by the age of 45 his phobia for germs became an obsession. While he felt he was free of germs, he always feared being attacked by them from the outside. His servants had elaborate rituals they had to follow, like washing their hands multiple times and covering them with paper tissues, when they served him food. He himself washed his hands until he literally bled. And he would cover his feet in tissue bags. If he came to know that any of his servants had fallrn sick, he would get his whole wardrobe burnt to free himself from the possiblity of germs. He became a recluse and practically met nobody apart from his closest aides. The last two decades of his life, he spent staying in hotels in the city. Finally, when he died at the age of 70, he had practically imprisoned himself frommthe world physically, and mentally he was incarcerated in his own dungeon. Here was someone who possessed so much of fame, money and power, and yet, he was miserable, not for lack of external opulences but merely because he had not learnt \\\"How to master his own thoughts and inner machinery\\\". On the other hand, let me give an example of somebody else who had practically nothing and yet is leading such a rich existence! This lady name is punpun. She was born in a poor region of Jharkhand in the district of plamua. When she was six years old, she used to take her family's buffalos for grazing. And while the buffalos were immersed in the lake, punpun, she would go to school and get beaten up bt her teachers for comming late. When she returned to get the buffalos, the neighboring farmers would beat her because the buffalos had gone into their field. When she was merely 10 years old, her poor parents married her off to a 21-year old. She had three children from that husband. When she was expecting for the fourth time, she got involved as an activist. The local mafia were using the women to lift cow dung. It was like the cow dung mafia. She infoemed of these activities to the collector. And the collector, when he took action, the mafia got annoyed. So they incited the husband, telling him that she had an affair with one of them. Now, the husband became so annoyed, he beat his wife and then thinking her to be dead he threw her into the cowshed. There a cow protected her. And she delivered her fourth child. She cut the umbilical cord with a stone. She took the baby to her pareny's home, they refused to tske her. Now, she knew she could not return. She wanted to commit suicide. She was about to throw herself on the railway track, when she heard the wailing of an old hungry man. She went to provide him solace and food and then realized that if she can help others, she can find meaning and purpose in her life. To stay away from molestation, she was residing in graveyards. And she was taking grain and cooking it on the fumeral pyres that were lit there. Once again she was about to commit suicide. But seeing the homeless hungry children on the footpaths, she decided to take care of a few of them and started begging to sustain them. Slowly, her efforts grew larger, and she created an orphanage and became known as the mother of the orphans. In order to ensure no bias towards her own child, she gave that child away in an orphanage. Now, people came to know of her wonderful efforts, and they started supporting her until she raised more and more children, many of them became graduates, post graduates and even phDs. Her own children came to know and they helped in her efforts. She says the most amazing moment was when her husband regretted and he came to her broken and dilapidated for shelter, very lovingly like a mother she offered him shelter and she says he is my naughtiest child. This the mother of orphans, is a blazing example of someone who externally was facing such hardships, but lifted her own thoughts, enriched her own mind to lend such a wonderful life. That is why i say there is a huge difference between the quality of your living and the quality of your life. The quality of your living is determined by the external opulence. The quality of our life is determined by our inner thousands. Our vedic scriptures have repeatedly emphasized the importance of the mind.Two thousands year ago, the first original jagatguru in Indian history, he said, asking the question, \\\"Who shall conquer the world?\\\" and the answer he provides himself, That person who has conquered his or her own mind. two thousands years after, He says, \\\"Look, whatever spiritual practice you engage in, do ensure that you are purifing your mind because \\\"Bondage & Liberation will both be determined by the state of our mind.\\\" There sre those who have learnt to master their mind. Very easily, any negative thoughts or emotions that enter, they reject them as unproductive and worthless. And they choose to delve on thoughts that are beneficial, that are uplifting and sublime. They tap into the inner inspiration to lead enriched lives. On the other hand are those who are slaves of their mind. They don't realize the gap between the environment and their mind because they have never thought of controlling it, and hence, they feel victimized by the circumstances, the situations outside, the behaviours of others. Consequently, they ride the roller coaster of their emotions. God has given us all many resources to lead the life we choose to. The primary amongst these is the inner machinery, called the mind. How many people listening to this video are blind? Most of us have these two eyes, with the help of which we can relish the beauty of the sunset at the beach, the grace of the eagle in flight, the glory of the mountains and the valleys in the Himalayas. We all have ears by which we are hearing any lecture. And you can relish the mirth of children and laughter, the rustling of the leaves by the wind, and the chirping of the birds. All of us have got this body This tremendous machinery that we have, what is missing? Our inablity to control the inner machinery, called the mind. That is why in the Gita Lord Krishna said, \\\"Arjun, this mind of yours, if it is controlled, it will become your best friend. But if it is uncontrolled, it will be your worst enemy.\\\" So Arjun, Shri Krishna says, Lift yourself by the power of your mind, Do  ot degrade yourself.\\\"\", React.createElement(\"br\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 219\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }), React.createElement(\"br\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 220\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }), React.createElement(\"h3\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 222\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, \"4.

His father was also a great sword fencer, but his father trained the other \n              sons and he gave up on this guy that you are no good. Nevertheless, Ram went to another the greatest \n              swordman of the land and he said, \"Will you teach me this?\" That master said, \"I will, but you will do \n              exactly as i say, and you will not use your intellect.\" Ram said, \"All right.\" Start cleaning the vessels \n              of the monastery. Ram Started cleaning the vessels. Then he had to cook, and then he had to clean the room,\n              and get the water from the rivet. And this went on and on and on. One year went by, second year went by.\n              He Started getting disappointed. There is no talking as well of the sword fencing i had come to learn it and \n              there is no question about it. I only clean vessels and take care of the house. A third year went by.\n              Finally, that master, he came from behind one day Ram was cleaning a vessel he wacked him. Ahh! \n              He said, \"Be careful. Henceforth I can come and hit you at any time. He said all right. Now he Started \n              developing his awareness and this master would come and whack him at any time. Slowly, slowly he Started\n              getting more and more alert until he would be able to gaze and judge and dodge. Until his awareness \n              developed even more when the merest whiff, and he would turn around and probably catch the stick or something.\n              The master said, \"Now you are ready. Now i will teach you sword fencing.\" So it's a question of being \n              completely aware. Don't make excuses. He is pretty stricy. He says irrespective of time, place, \n              circumstance make it like a universal vow. Make it a commitment. When you are interested in something, \n              You do it when you like. When you are commitment to something, you do it whether you like or you don't like.\n              That's the kind of commitment he is demanding. Don't make compromises. This will require tremendous awareness.\n              You know the opposite of awareness is carelessness. The devotees have their own way of being aware.\n              Be aware of the presence of God. Maharajji says 'Be aware that God and Guru are with you and watching you all the time.'\n              This kind of carelessness require a great motivation and a great dedication. You need to have complete lack \n              of carelessness and complete application to the task. This will come, when you have a strong why. A strong \n              reason motivating you. And the biggest reason motivating us is that the human form is a golden chance for the \n              salvation of the soul. If we don't utilize it, we will go back. 'Aji sahab, you are a human being in this life \n              what are you going to become in your next life?'. 'Ji, I am going to become a dhobi ka gadha.'\n              My God! After the human being you're becoming a dhobi ka gadha? You've gone that down? Yes, I did not \n              utilize the chance i had. The oppertunity is tremendous, but the time span is limited. And that time is \n              slipping out of our hands. You know, like you lift up sand on the beach and you find it is slipping out until \n              nothing is left so also is human life. We think I've got so many years, but without realizing it one by one the \n              years go by. It was only a few years ago that you passed out of collage. It was only a few more years before \n              that you enered school as a little child. How quickly the time has gone by. How quickly 2020 went by. Half of 2022 \n              has also disappeared and it's never going to come back. Did we make the best use of it? One moment that we wasted\n              is one moment lost forever. Mahatma said, What is the biggest loss in life? That moment which you don't utilize\n              in remembering Shri Krishna. And why don't we utilize? Carelessness We know what we are supposed to do, but we \n              don't do it because of carelessness. That carelessness makes us waste, squander the oppertunity. That is why to \n              implement this we need to motivate ourselves. You see, when the motivation is there, the most challenging thing \n              becomes easy and when the motivation is not there, the smallest difficulty seems like an unassailable wall.\n              This motivation has to come, in other words, a deep hunger. Guru has said three special graces of God. The first is the human form.\n              Everybody here has got that grace. The second is the guidance of the saints. That also we have got. The third is hunger.\n              Hunger for the Ultimate Goal. You all have got it to a certain extent, that's why your have come here. \n              But that one grace needs to be enhanced. In other word, the hunger has to be deepened. The deeper the hunger, \n              the harder we shall endeavor the more careful we will be. \n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n\n            <h3>2.3 UNTOLD Powers of a 100% Focussed Mind.</h3>\n            The goal of life is to attain the Supreme Lord. This can only happen when our mind attains complete\n            and absolute absorption in the divine. And that can be done by developing the ability for concentration.\n            Razor sharp focus is one of the most powerful mental faculties that we can possess. Take a look at the \n            power of laser beams. They are energized by a few watts of energy and they contain just light rays.\n            But because of the intensity of the focus, they are used for drilling holes in diamonds that are amongst \n            the hardest things on this planet. In contrast, is the sun. It emits billions of kilowatts of light energy\n            to the earth every minute. And yet you can conveniently walk under the sunlight with a light umbrella on \n            your head without getting burnt. So what is the difference b/w ordinary sunlight and laser beams? It lies in the \n            intensity of the focus. Likewise, is the focus in stream engines. Now, water vapor evaporates in hundreds of \n            tons from lakes, stream, seas and oceans. It does not burn anyone, but the water vapor when it is focused \n            in the piston of the stream engine, and brought to bear with intensity in that railway engine it empowers it \n            to pull thousands of tons of steel and iron at hurtling speeds on those railway tracks. That is the power of focus.\n            Similarly, if we can develop mental focus, we can bring intensity to any physical or intellectual work that we perform.\n            Focus declutter our mind. If you have had the experience of driving a car in a rain-storm, you will be aware how it blurs\n            up vision. That is way cars come with the feature of vipers for retaining clarity. Likewise, to make good decision \n            in life. we need to declutter our mind from the distraction all around us. And that can be done by developingvthe \n            ability for concentration. Just as an artist did  in the time of Mahant. This great sage went from Dakshineswar to \n            Kplkata to participate in the ratha yatra if Lord Jagarnath. He reached late and the chariot had passed by.\n            He asked a shopkeeper, \"Has the ratha of Lord Jagarnath gone by from here?\" The shopkeeper was a painter. He said, \n            \"No, not yet.\" The neighboring shopkeeper corrected him. \"Why are you telling lies to such a big Mahatma?\n            It went by a couple of hours ago.\" The pinter said, \"I never saw it.\" His neibhbor said, \"Never mind, you \n            must have heard the jkankj, the manjira, the mridangasm the drums?\" The painter said, \"I never heard anything.\"\n            Mahatma was astonished. He sat there in meditation and realizd this painter is telling the truth. He came out \n            of his meditation and touched his feet and said, \"The world calls me a mahatma, but your mind is so incredibly \n            focused you were so absorbed in your painting that the whole procession went by with hundreds of people\n            and you did not come to know.\" That is how focus declutters our mind, and it enhances our ability to understand.\n            So for example, when you sit in a class listening to a talk or a lecture, the more you focus, the better is \n            your comprehension. And if the focus is diffused, the mind wanders away. Your ability to understand also \n            gets affected. Try this experiment early in the morning when you wake up, use that first one hour tolearn \n            some new subject. You will discover your brain is working like sponge and it has 400% efficiency compared \n            to doing the same activity in the evening when the mind is cluttered by the daily exposure. So that is how \n            focus enhances our ability to understand. Focus is also necessary for learning new skills. These require \n            bringing our mental and intellectual abilities to bear upon mastering an art. Sunil Gavaskar one of the \n            greatest batsmen in the world ever, the one who broke Bradman's record for the maximum number of Test centuries \n            which stood at 29. Sunil Gavaskar scored 34 Test centuries and his record was subsequently broken again, \n            but he was asked What iis the secret of your virtuoso batting? He said, \"My ability to focus. I keep my \n            eyes on the ball.\" Focus also helps us enhance our mental state. Usually we let thoughts happens to us \n            as reactions to events in the environment. But when we have focus, we can then choose the feelings that \n            we wish to harbor. And this frees us, us from the clutches of the mind. We feel better about ourselves \n            and can take charge of our life. And finally, focus can help us attain God. Let's read about it from my \n            latest book, The goal of life is to attain the Supreme Lord. This can only happen when our mind attains\n            complete and absolute absorption in the divine. The Gita states, just as a lamp in a windless place does \n            not flicker, so the disciplined mind of a yogi remains steady in meditation on the Supreme. When the mind \n            restrained from material activities becomes still in the practice of Uog, then the yogi is able to behold \n            the soul through the purified mind, and he rejoices in inner joy. In that joyous state of yog called Samadhi,\n            one experiences supreme, boundless, divine bliss. And thus situated one never deviates from the eternal truth.\n            Gita says Despite the benefits of focus, we find that we are besieged by absent mindedness. We suffer \n            from the shattered focus syndrome. Our mind has this propensity, this novelty bias, and therefore we'll \n            have to work hard to enhance our concentration. We learn how to do that in the next couple of weeks.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n\n            <h3>3. Control your Mind in 21 Days - How it Works.</h3>\n            This mind of ours, If it is controlled it will become our best friend. Lift ourself by the power of our mind.\n            Do not degrade ourself.\n            The mind is a place of its own and in itself can make Heaven out of Hell or Hell out of Heaven. These were the \n            words of John Milton, a weatern philosopher. And how true they are! We may possess Money, Fame, Poweb yet, If \n            we have not learnt to Master our Mind. We will not experience the Happiness and fulfillment That we are searching\n            for in our life. Consider the example of one of the richest persons in history, Howard. He had so much of wealth!\n            Amongst his many businesses, he became a film producer in Hollywood, and developed a reputation for being a \n            playboy who went out with many famous heroines. However, by the age of 45 his phobia for germs became an \n            obsession. While he felt he was free of germs, he always feared being attacked by them from the outside. \n            His servants had elaborate rituals they had to follow, like washing their hands multiple times and covering them \n            with paper tissues, when they served him food. He himself washed his hands until he literally bled. And he would \n            cover his feet in tissue bags. If he came to know that any of his servants had fallrn sick, he would get his whole \n            wardrobe burnt to free himself from the possiblity of germs. He became a recluse and practically met nobody apart from \n            his closest aides. The last two decades of his life, he spent staying in hotels in the city. Finally, when he died \n            at the age of 70, he had practically imprisoned himself frommthe world physically, and mentally he was incarcerated\n            in his own dungeon. Here was someone who possessed so much of fame, money and power, and yet, he was miserable, not \n            for lack of external opulences but merely because he had not learnt \"How to master his own thoughts and inner machinery\".\n            On the other hand, let me give an example of somebody else who had practically nothing and yet is leading such a rich \n            existence! This lady name is punpun. She was born in a poor region of Jharkhand in the district of plamua. When she was \n            six years old, she used to take her family's buffalos for grazing. And while the buffalos were immersed in the lake,\n            punpun, she would go to school and get beaten up bt her teachers for comming late. When she returned to get the buffalos,\n            the neighboring farmers would beat her because the buffalos had gone into their field. When she was merely 10 years old,\n            her poor parents married her off to a 21-year old. She had three children from that husband. When she was expecting for the \n            fourth time, she got involved as an activist. The local mafia were using the women to lift cow dung. It was like the cow \n            dung mafia. She infoemed of these activities to the collector. And the collector, when he took action, the mafia got annoyed.\n            So they incited the husband, telling him that she had an affair with one of them. Now, the husband became so annoyed, he beat \n            his wife and then thinking her to be dead he threw her into the cowshed. There a cow protected her. And she delivered her fourth \n            child. She cut the umbilical cord with a stone. She took the baby to her pareny's home, they refused to tske her. Now, she knew \n            she could not return. She wanted to commit suicide. She was about to throw herself on the railway track, when she \n            heard the wailing of an old hungry man. She went to provide him solace and food and then realized that if she can help others,\n            she can find meaning and purpose in her life. To stay away from molestation, she was residing in graveyards. And she was \n            taking grain and cooking it on the fumeral pyres that were lit there. Once again she was about to commit suicide.\n            But seeing the homeless hungry children on the footpaths, she decided to take care of a few of them and started begging to \n            sustain them. Slowly, her efforts grew larger, and she created an orphanage and became known as the mother of the orphans.\n            In order to ensure no bias towards her own child, she gave that child away in an orphanage. Now, people came to know of her \n            wonderful efforts, and they started supporting her until she raised more and more children, many of them became graduates, \n            post graduates and even phDs. Her own children came to know and they helped in her efforts. She says the most amazing \n            moment was when her husband regretted and he came to her broken and dilapidated for shelter, very lovingly like a mother \n            she offered him shelter and she says he is my naughtiest child. This the mother of orphans, is a blazing example of someone\n            who externally was facing such hardships, but lifted her own thoughts, enriched her own mind to lend such a wonderful life.\n            That is why i say there is a huge difference between the quality of your living and the quality of your life. The quality of \n            your living is determined by the external opulence. The quality of our life is determined by our inner thousands. Our vedic scriptures \n            have repeatedly emphasized the importance of the mind.Two thousands year ago, the first original jagatguru in Indian history,\n            he said, asking the question, \"Who shall conquer the world?\" and the answer he provides himself, That person who has conquered \n            his or her own mind. two thousands years after, He says, \"Look, whatever spiritual practice you engage in, do ensure that you are purifing\n            your mind because \"Bondage & Liberation will both be determined by the state of our mind.\" There sre those who have learnt \n            to master their mind. Very easily, any negative thoughts or emotions that enter, they reject them as unproductive and worthless.\n            And they choose to delve on thoughts that are beneficial, that are uplifting and sublime. They tap into the inner inspiration \n            to lead enriched lives. On the other hand are those who are slaves of their mind. They don't realize the gap between the environment \n            and their mind because they have never thought of controlling it, and hence, they feel victimized by the circumstances, \n            the situations outside, the behaviours of others. Consequently, they ride the roller coaster of their emotions. God has given \n            us all many resources to lead the life we choose to. The primary amongst these is the inner machinery, called the mind.\n            How many people listening to this video are blind? Most of us have these two eyes, with the help of which we can relish \n            the beauty of the sunset at the beach, the grace of the eagle in flight, the glory of the mountains and the valleys in the \n            Himalayas. We all have ears by which we are hearing any lecture. And you can relish the mirth of children and laughter,\n            the rustling of the leaves by the wind, and the chirping of the birds. All of us have got this body This tremendous machinery\n            that we have, what is missing? Our inablity to control the inner machinery, called the mind. That is why in the Gita Lord Krishna said,\n            \"Arjun, this mind of yours, if it is controlled, it will become your best friend. But if it is uncontrolled, it will be your \n            worst enemy.\" So Arjun, Shri Krishna says, Lift yourself by the power of your mind, Do  ot degrade yourself.\"    \n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n\n            <h3>4.

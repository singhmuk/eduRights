Please explain the various features of Angular.</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Angular CLI</li>\n                <li>Animation Support</li>\n                <li>Cross-Platform App Development</li>\n                <li>Code Splitting</li>\n                <li>Declarative UI</li>\n                <li>Testing</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>4. Describe the MVVM architecture. </h3>\n              MVVM architecture removes tight coupling between each component. The MVVM architecture comprises of three parts:\n              <br />\n              <ul>\n                <li>Model</li>\n                <li>View</li>\n                <li>ViewModel</li>\n              </ul>\n              The architecture allows the children to have reference through observables and not directly to their parents.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>5. Can you explain the concept of scope hierarchy in Angular?</h3>\n              Angular organizes the $scope objects into a hierarchy that is typically used by views. \n              It has a root scope that can further contain one or several scopes called child scopes.\n              <br />\n              In a scope hierarchy, each view has its own $scope.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>6. What is multicasting</h3>\n              Multi-casting is the process of broadcasting to a list of multiple subscribers in a single execution.\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={multicasting}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>7. What are the building blocks of Angular?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Components</li>\n                <li>Data Binding</li>\n                <li>Dependency Injection (DI)</li>\n                <li>Directives</li>\n                <li>Metadata(decorators are used)</li>\n                <li>Modules</li>\n                <li>Routing</li>\n                <li>Services</li>\n                <li>Template</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>8. What is ViewEncapsulation and how many ways are there to do it in Angular?</h3>\n              ViewEncapsulation determines whether the styles defined in a particular component\n              will affect the entire application or not. Angular supports 3 types of ViewEncapsulation:\n              <ul>\n                <li><b>Emulated: </b>Styles used in other HTML spread to the component</li>\n                <li><b>Native: </b>Styles used in other HTML doesn’t spread to the component</li>\n                <li><b>None: </b>Styles defined in a component are visible to all components of the application</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>1o. What modules should you import in Angular to use [(ngModel)] and reactive forms?</h3>\n              FormsModule and Reactiveforms Module.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>11. How many Change Detectors can there be in the whole application?</h3>\n              Each component has its own ChangeDetector. All Change Detectors are inherited from\n              AbstractChangeDetector.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>12. What is zone</h3>\n              Zone. js is a api or set of programs which is used by angular to update the application view when any\n              change occurred.\n              <br />\n              <b>Ex.: </b>Events, XMLHttpRequests and Timers(setTimeout(), setInterval()) etc.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>13. How do you update the view if your data model is updated outside the ‘Zone’?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Using the <b>ApplicationRef.prototype.tick</b> method, which will run change detection on the entire component tree.</li>\n                <li>Using <b>NgZone.prototype.run</b> method, which will also run change detection on the entire tree. The run method under the hood itself calls tick, and the parameter takes the function you want to perform before tick.</li>\n                <li>Using the <b>ChangeDetectorRef.prototype.detectChanges</b> method, which will launch change detection on the current component and its children.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>14. What are Core and Shared modules for?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>A Shared module serves as a generic module for all modules, components, directives, pipes, etc., which are not required to be in a single copy for the application but need to be imported into many different modules.</li>\n                <li>A Core module is a place to store services that you need to have in the form of singleton for the entire application (for example, a user authorization service with data storage about it).</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              \n\n              <h3>17. Ivy Compiler</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Ivy is now default compiler and runtime. Ivy improves budle size, allows for better debugging, adds improves type checking, faster testing, enables the AOT compiler on by default, and improves CSS class and style binding.</li>\n                <li>Reach better build times.</li>\n                <li>reach better build sizes (with a generated code more compatible with tree-shaking).</li>\n                <li>Unlock new potential features (metaprogramming or higher order components, lazy loading of component instead of modules).</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>18. What is the use of Bazel in Angular 8.</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>It provides a platform to make back-end and front-end services with the same tool.</li>\n                <li>It allows us to build CLI applications quickly and easily.</li>\n                <li>The entirety of the Angular framework is built on Bazel and it allows us to divide an\n                  application into various build units which are defined at the NgModule level.</li>\n                <li>It supports customization and also facilitates us to draw graphs. We can use these graphs to\n                  easily identify the essential information.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>19. Why we should use Bazel for Angular builds</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>The initial build time with Bazel will be comparable\n                  to the traditional JavaScript tooling. the difference is that the time will not grow exponentially when our\n                  application’s size increases. With Bazel most of the time the build time will stay constant.</li>\n                <li>Bazel rebuilds only the packages which have changed and nothing else.</li>\n              </ul>\n\n              <h3>20. There are two kinds of compilation that Angular provides</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li><b>JIT compilation: </b>Just-in-Time is a type of compilation that compiles your app in the\n                  browser at runtime. JIT compilation is the default when you run the ng build (build only) or ng serve (build and serve locally).</li>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>A JIT compiler runs after the program has started and compiles the code (usually bytecode or some kind of VM instructions).\n                    A JIT has access to dynamic runtime information whereas a standard compiler doesn't and can make better optimizations like\n                    inlining functions that are used frequently.</li>\n                  <li>This is in contrast to a traditional compiler that compiles all the code to machine language before the program is first run.</li>\n                </ul>\n                <br />\n                <li><b>AOT(Ahead-of-Time) compilation: </b>Ahead-of-Time is a type of compilation that compiles your\n                  app at build time. For AOT compilation, include the --aot option with the ng build or ng serve command.</li>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>The Angular AOT compiler pre-compiles application components and their templates during the\n                    build process. Apps compiled with AOT launch faster for several reasons.</li>\n                  <li>Application components execute immediately, without client-side compilation.</li>\n                  <li>Templates are embedded as code within their components so there is no client-side request for\n                    template files.</li>\n                  <li>You don't download the Angular compiler, which is pretty big on its own.</li>\n                  <li>The compiler discards unused Angular directives that a tree-shaking tool can then exclude.</li>\n                </ul>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>21. What is the use of Codelyzer</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>All enterprise applications follows a set of coding conventions and guidelines to maintain code\n                  in better way.

Why should ngOnInit be used, if we already have a constructor</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>The Constructor is a default method of the class that is executed when the class is instantiated\n                  and ensures proper initialization of fields in the class and its subclasses.</li>\n                <li>ngOnInit is a life cycle hook called by Angular to indicate that Angular is done creating the\n                  component.</li>\n                <li>We use ngOnInit for all the initialization/ declaration in the constructor. The constructor should only be used to\n                  initialize class members but shouldn't do actual \"work\". So you should use constructor() to setup Dependency Injection\n                  and not much else. ngOnInit() is better place to \"start\" - it's where/ when components' bindings are resolved.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>23. Are there any pros/ cons in using local storage to replace cookie functionality.</h3>\n              Cookies and local storage serve different purposes.\n              <ul>\n                <li>Cookies are primarily for reading server-side,</li>\n                <li>Local Storage can only be read by the client-side.</li>\n                <li>If data needs client, then by all means switch to local storage. You're wasting bandwidth by\n                  sending all the data in each HTTP header.</li>\n                <li>If data needs server, local storage is  okay if the server only needs\n                  a small subset of the total data for each request.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>23. Explain the purpose of Service Workers in Angular</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>A service worker is a script that runs in the web browser and manages caching for an application.</li>\n                <li>Service workers work as a network proxy. They intercept all outgoing HTTP requests made by\n                  the application and can choose how to respond to them.</li>\n                <li>The service worker is preserved after the user closes the tab. The next time that browser loads\n                  the application, the service worker loads first, and can intercept every request for resources to\n                  load the application.

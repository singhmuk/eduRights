To do this, we need to type the following command:\", React.createElement(\"br\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 473\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }), React.createElement(\"b\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 474\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, \"ng add @nguniversal/express-engine\"), React.createElement(\"br\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 475\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }), React.createElement(\"br\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 476\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }), \"This allows our Angular application to work well with an ExpressJS web server that compiles HTML pages with Angular Universal based on client requests. This also creates the server-side app module, app.server.module.ts, in our application directory.\", React.createElement(\"br\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 478\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }), React.createElement(\"h3\", {\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 480\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, \"49. What is the difference between interpolated content and the content assigned to the innerHTML property of a DOM element?\"), \"Angular interpolation happens when in our template we type some JavaScript expression inside double curly braces\", React.createElement(\"div\", {\n      style: titles,\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 482\n      },\n      __self: this\n    }, React.createElement(PrismCode, {\n      code: javaScriptExp,\n      language: \"js\",\n      plugins: [\"line-numbers\"],\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 483\n      },\n      __self: this\n    })), \". This is used to add dynamic content to a web page. However, we can do the same by assigning some dynamic content to the innerHTML property of a DOM element. The difference between the two is that, in Angular, the compiler always escapes the interpolated content, i.e., HTML is not interpreted, and the browser displays the code as it is with brackets and symbols, rather than displaying the output of the interpreted HTML. However, in innerHTML, if the content is HTML, then it is interpreted as the HTML code.\"))));\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default

What is the use of router-outlet in angular 8.</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>The router-outlet is a directive that's used by the router to mark where in a template, a matched component\n                  should be inserted.</li>\n                <br />\n                <li>Our app will have multiple views/ pages and the app template acts like a shell of our application. \n                  Any element, we add to the shell\n                  will be rendered in each view, only the part marked by the router outlet will be changed between views.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>4. Can I use multiple router outlets in Angular 8?</h3>\n              Yes! We can use multiple router-outlets in same template by configuring our routers and simply add the router-outlet name.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>5. How do you make a router link in HTML?</h3>\n              Linking Routes in HTML.\n              <ol>\n                <li>To add links to one of the routes, use the routerLink directive in HTML. This directive accepts an array.</li>\n                <li>If you use the routerLink directive without the brackets, you'll need to pass the route as a string.</li>\n                <li>The <b>router-outlet</b> <b>/router-outlet</b> acts as a placeholder for components.</li>\n              </ol>\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={counters}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>6. Difference between navigate and navigatebyurl in angular.</h3>\n              navigateByUrl is similar to changing the location bar directly–we are providing the “whole” new URL. Whereas router. navigate creates a new URL by applying an array\n              of passed-in commands, a patch, to the current URL.\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={addcomponents}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>7. How do you detect route change in Angular?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Import Router, Event, NavigationStart, NavigationEnd, NavigationError from ‘@angular/router’.</li>\n                <li>And inject router in the constructor.</li>\n                <li>Subscribe to the NavigationStart, NavigationEnd, NavigationError events of the router.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>8. What is this router navigate?</h3>\n              navigate method, you must supply the ActivatedRoute to give the router knowledge of where you are in the current route tree. After the link parameters array, add an\n              object with a relativeTo property set to the ActivatedRoute . The router then calculates the target URL based on the active route’s location.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>9. When to use Route class in case of navigation?</h3>\n              Using Route class in case of navigation to happen on a triggered event. Before performing the above two operations, there is a need to register this component in the\n              Route class’s instance which lies inside the app-routing.module.ts file. This will be further used to navigate from child to parent.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>10. Is there a way to navigate between routes in angular?</h3>\n              You can also navigate imperatively by using the code. This is done using the router service, which provides navigate and navigatebyUrl methods via which you can\n              perform route changes.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>11. How to specify which route to navigate to in NavLink?</h3>\n              To specify which route to navigate to, use the to prop and pass the path name. The activeClassName prop will add an active class to the link if it’s currently active.\n              On the browser, the NavLink component is rendered as an tag with an href attribute value that was passed in the to prop.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>12. When to use absolute path in navigate method?</h3>\n              Navigate Method always uses the absolute path unless you provide a starting point. <b>navigate.navigateByUrl</b> Use this method if you want to navigate to a URL by using\n              the absolute path. The first argument is a string containing the complete URL.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>13. What is the use of EventEmitter in angular.</h3>\n                EventEmitter is used with @Output directive to emit custom events asynchronously and synchronously, and register \n                handlers for those events by subscribing to an instance.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>15. What is the use of template in angular.</h3>\n              A template is a form of HTML that tells Angular how to render the component. Views are allowing to modify, show or\n              hide entire UI sections or pages as a unit.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>16. What is the use of shared module in angular.</h3>\n              A Shared Module is used to organize a set of commonly used pieces into one module and export them to any other \n              module that imports the Share Module. This allows us to selectively aggregate the reusable components.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>17. What is provider in angular.</h3>\n                Providers are usually singleton (one instance) objects, that other objects have access to through dependency injection (DI).\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>18. What is ng-template in Angular?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>ng-template is an Angular element that is used for rendering HTML in a template. However, it is not rendered directly on DOM. If you include an ng-template tag\n                  to a template, the tag and the content inside it will be replaced by comment upon render.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>19. What is difference between package.json and package-lock.json.</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li><b>package.json: </b>Records important metadata about the project.</li>\n                <li><b>package.lock.json: </b>Allows future devs to install the same dependencies in the project.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>20. How do you handle error in Angular?</h3>\n              By using ErrorHandler class. This class can be extended to create your own global error handler.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>21. Pass complex JSON via routerLink.</h3>\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={routerLink}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>22. How does an Angular application work?</h3>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>Every Angular app consists of a file named angular.json. This file will contain all the configurations of \n                    the app. While building the app, the builder looks at this file to find the entry point of the application. </li>\n                  <li>Inside the build section, the main property of the options object defines the entry point of the application \n                    which is main.ts.\n                      The main.ts file creates a browser environment for the application to run and along with this, it also calls a function called bootstrapModule, which bootstraps the application. These two steps are performed in the following order inside the main.ts file:</li>\n                  <b>platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)</b>\n                  <br/>\n                  <li>In the above line of code, AppModule is getting bootstrapped.\n                      The AppModule is declared in the app.module.ts file. This module contains declarations of all the components.</li>\n                  <li>Now, AppComponent is getting bootstrapped.</li>\n                  <li>This component is defined in app.component.ts file. This file interacts with the webpage and serves data to it.</li>\n                </ul>\n                <br/>\n\n                Each component is declared with three properties:\n                <ul>\n                  <li><b>Selector: </b>used for accessing the component.</li>\n                  <li><b>Template/TemplateURL: </b>contains HTML of the component.</li>\n                  <li><b>StylesURL: </b>contains component-specific stylesheets.</li>\n                </ul>\n                After this, Angular calls the index.html file. This file consequently calls the root component that is app-root. The root component is defined in app.component.ts.\n                <br/>\n                This is how every angular application works.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>23. What are some of the advantages of Angular over other frameworks?</h3>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>Features that are provided out of the box</li>\n                  <li>Declarative UI</li>\n                  <li>Long-term Google support</li>\n                </ul>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>24. What is AOT compilation? What are the advantages of AOT?</h3>\n              Every Angular application consists of components and templates which the browser cannot understand. Therefore, all the Angular applications need to be compiled first before running inside the browser.\n              <br/>\n              Angular provides two types of compilation:\n              <ul>\n                <li>JIT(Just-in-Time) compilation</li>\n                <li>AOT(Ahead-of-Time) compilation</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br/>\n              The advantages of using AOT compilation are:\n              <ul>\n                <li>Since the application compiles before running inside the browser, the browser loads the executable code and renders the application immediately, which leads to faster rendering.</li>\n                <li>In AOT compilation, the compiler sends the external HTML and CSS files along with the application, eliminating separate AJAX requests for those source files, which leads to fewer ajax requests.</li>\n                <li>Developers can detect and handle errors during the building phase, which helps in minimizing errors.</li>\n                <li>The AOT compiler adds HTML and templates into the JS files before they run inside the browser. Due to this, there are no extra HTML files to be read, which provide better security to the application.</li>\n                <br/>\n                <li>By default, angular builds and serves the application using JIT compiler:\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>ng build</li>\n                    <li>ng serve</li>\n                  </ul>\n                </li>\n                <br/>\n                <li>For using AOT compiler following changes should be made:\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>ng build --aot</li>\n                    <li>ng serve --aot</li>\n                  </ul>\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>25. Explain Components, Modules and Services in Angular.</h3>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>In Angular, components are the basic building blocks, which control a part of the UI for any application.</li>\n                  <li>A component is defined using the @Component decorator. Every component consists of three parts, the template which loads the view for the component, a stylesheet which defines the look and feel for the component, and a class that contains the business logic for the component.</li>\n                </ul>\n                <br/>\n                <b>Modules: </b>A module is a place where we can group components, directives, services, and pipes. Module decides whether the components, directives, etc can be used by other modules, by exporting or hiding these elements. Every module is defined with a <b>@NgModule</b> decorator.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                By default, modules are of two types:\n                <ul>\n                  <li><b>Root Module: </b></li>\n                  <li><b>Feature Module: </b>Every application can have only one root module whereas, it can have one or more feature modules.\n                  <ol>\n                    <li>A root module imports BrowserModule,</li>\n                    <li>whereas a feature module imports CommonModule.</li>\n                  </ol>\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n                <br/>\n                <b>Services: </b>Services are objects which get instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application. The main objective of a service is to share data, functions with different components of an Angular application.\n                <br/>\n                A service is defined using a <b>@Injectable</b> decorator. A function defined inside a service can be invoked from any component or directive.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>26.

Functionality of a service, can be needed by various components and directives in an application. Angular provides a smooth mechanism by which we can inject these dependencies in our components and directives.\n                    So basically, we are just making dependencies which are injectable across all components of an application.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>33. What are Annotations in Angular?</h3>\n              Annotations are the hard-coded language feature. Annotations are only metadata set on the class that is used to reflect the metadata library.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>34. What are filters in Angular? Name a few of them.</h3>\n              Filters are used to format an expression and present it to the user. They can be used in view templates, controllers, or services. Some inbuilt filters are as follows.\n              <ol>\n                <li>Date</li>\n                <li>filter</li>\n                <li>Json</li>\n                <li>limitTo</li>\n                <li>lowercase</li>\n              </ol>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>35. What do you understand by scope in Angular?</h3>\n              The scope in Angular binds the HTML and the JavaScript. It as expected is an object with the available methods and \n              properties. The scope is available for both the view and the controller.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>36. What are Template statements?</h3>\n              Template statements are properties or methods used in HTML for responding to user events. \n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={templates}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>37. What is Bootstrap? How is it embedded into Angular?</h3>\n              Bootstrap is a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools for creating and building responsive web pages and \n              web applications.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>38. What type of DOM does Angular implement?</h3>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>DOM (Document Object Model) treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure in which each node is an object representing a part of the document.</li>\n                  <li>Angular uses the regular DOM. This updates the entire tree structure of HTML tags until it reaches the data to be updated. However, to ensure that the speed and performance are not affected, Angular implements Change Detection.</li>\n                </ul>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>41. What is DOM?</h3>\n              It is responsible for representing the content of a web page and changes in the architecture of an application. Here, all the objects are organized in the form of a tree, and the document can easily be modified, manipulated, and accessed only with the help of APIs.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>42. What does subscribing mean in RxJS?</h3>\n              In RxJS, when using observables, we need to subscribe to an observable to use the data that flows through that observable. This data is generated from a publisher and is consumed by a subscriber. When we subscribe to an observable, we pass in a function for the data and another function for errors so that, in case there is some error, we can show some message or process the message in some way.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>43. What is Angular Router?</h3>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>Routing in a single-page frontend application is the task of responding to the changes in the URL made by \n                    adding and removing content from the application. In this task as we first need to intercept a request that \n                    changes the browser’s URL as we do not wish for the browser to reload. Then, we need to determine which \n                    content to remove and which content to add, and finally, we have to change the browser’s URL as well to \n                    show the user the current page they are on.</li>\n                </ul>\n              <br/>\n              <h3>44.

What is HttpClient, and what are its benefits?</h3>\n                Angular applications communicate with backend services over HTTP protocol using HttpClient which is based on top of the XMLHttpRequest interface.\n                <br/>\n                <b>advantages:</b>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>Contains testability features</li>\n                  <li>Provides typed request and response objects</li>\n                  <li>Intercept request and response</li>\n                  <li>Supports Observable APIs</li>\n                  <li>Supports streamlined error handling</li>\n                </ul>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>47. What is server-side rendering in Angular?</h3>\n              In a normal Angular application, the browser executes our application, and JavaScript handles all the user interactions. However, because of this, sometimes, if we have a large application with a big bundle size, our page’s load speed is slowed down quite a bit as it needs to download all the files, parse JavaScript, and then execute it. To overcome this slowness, we can use server-side rendering, which allows us to send a fully rendered page from the server that the browser can display and then let the JavaScript code take over any subsequent interactions from the user.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>48. What is Angular Universal?</h3>\n              Angular Universal is a package for enabling server-side rendering in Angular applications. We can easily make our application ready for server-side rendering using the Angular CLI. To do this, we need to type the following command:<br/>\n              <b>ng add @nguniversal/express-engine</b>\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              This allows our Angular application to work well with an ExpressJS web server that compiles HTML pages with Angular Universal based on client requests. This also creates the server-side app module, app.server.module.ts, in our application directory.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>49. What is the difference between interpolated content and the content assigned to the innerHTML property of a DOM element?</h3>\n              Angular interpolation happens when in our template we type some JavaScript expression inside double curly braces \n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={javaScriptExp}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>.\n               This is used to add dynamic content to a web page. However, we can do the same by assigning some dynamic content to the innerHTML property of a DOM element. The difference between the two is that, in Angular, the compiler always escapes the interpolated content, i.e., HTML is not interpreted, and the browser displays the code as it is with brackets and symbols, rather than displaying the output of the interpreted HTML. However, in innerHTML, if the content is HTML, then it is interpreted as the HTML code.\n            </List>\n          </Paper>\n        </Grid>\n      </Grid>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default (withStyles(styles)(NgrxCounter));\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}

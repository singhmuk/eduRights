If you remove an object attribute, is it deleted from the database?</h3>\n              <p>Yes, it is deleted. Hence, it is better to eliminate the attribute and then save the object again.</p>\n              <br />\n              <img src={mongoDB} alt=\"Omega\" className=\"responsive\" style={redesign} />\n              <br />\n              <br />\n\n\n              <h3>3. Explain the situation when an index does not fit into RAM.</h3>\n              <p>\n                Indexes do not have to fit entirely into RAM in all cases. If the value of the indexed field increments with every\n                insert, and most queries select recently added documents; then MongoDB only needs to keep the parts of the index that\n                hold the most recent or “right-most” values in RAM. This allows for efficient index use for read and write operations\n                and minimize the amount of RAM required to support the index.\n              </p>\n              <img src={Index} alt=\"Omega\" className=\"responsive\" style={redesign} />\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <br />\n\n              <b>Likes Comments</b>\n              <br />\n              <img src={mongoLikes} alt=\"Omega\" className=\"responsive\" style={redesign} />\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>4. How does MongoDB provide consistency?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  MongoDB uses the reader–writer locks, allowing simultaneous readers to access any supply like a database or a\n                  collection but always offering private access to single writes.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  MongoDB is consistent by default: reads and writes are issued to the primary member of a replica set. Applications\n                  can optionally read from secondary replicas, where data is eventually consistent by default.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  Eventual consistency means, if no updates are made to a given data\n                  item for a “long enough” period of time, sometime after hardware and network failures heal, then, eventually, all\n                  reads to that item will return the same consistent value.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>5. What is the use of Journaling in MongoDB?</h3>\n              <p>Journaling is used for safe backups in MongoDB.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>6. What is the use of Profiler?</h3>\n              <p>Profiler is used to show the performance characteristics of every operation against the database.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>7. What is Vertical Scaling?</h3>\n              <p>Vertical scaling adds more CPU and storage resources to increase capacity.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>8. Define Horizontal Scaling.</h3>\n              <p>Horizontal scaling divides the dataset and distributes data over multiple servers, or shards.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>9. What are the components of the Sharded cluster?</h3>\n              <p>The sharded cluster has the following components: </p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Shards</li>\n                <li>Query routers</li>\n                <li>Config servers</li>\n              </ul>\n\n              <h3>10. What is the use of the pretty() method?</h3>\n              <p>The pretty() method is used to show the results in a formatted way.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>11. What is the use of the dot notation in MongoDB?</h3>\n              <p>MongoDB uses the dot notation to access the elements of an array and the fields of an embedded document.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>12. What is Splitting in MongoDB?</h3>\n              <p>Splitting is a background process that is used to keep chunks from growing too large.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>13. What is the difference between MongoDB(non-relational) and MySQL(relational)?</h3>\n              <p>There is a lot of difference between them in:</p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Terms of data representation</li>\n                <li>Relationships</li>\n                <li>Transaction</li>\n                <li>Querying data</li>\n                <li>Schema design and definition</li>\n                <li>Performance</li>\n                <li>Speed</li>\n                <li>Normalization.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>14. Explain the structure of ObjectID in MongoDB.</h3>\n              <p>\n                ObjectIds are small, likely unique, fast to generate, and ordered. ObjectId values consist of 12 bytes, where the\n                first four bytes are a timestamp that reflect the ObjectId’s creation.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>15. Why MongoDB is not preferred over a 32-bit system?</h3>\n              <p>\n                When running a 32-bit build of MongoDB, the total storage size for the server, including data and indexes, is 2\n                gigabytes. For this reason, do not deploy MongoDB to production on 32-bit machines. If you're running a 64-bit build\n                of MongoDB, there's virtually no limit to storage size.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>16. Does MongoDB support ACID transaction management and locking functionalities?</h3>\n              <p>\n                Historically MongoDB does not support default multi-document ACID transactions (multiple-document updates that can be\n                rolled back and are ACID-compliant). However, MongoDB provides atomic operation on a single document.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>17. Should I normalize my data before storing it in MongoDB?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  It depends from your goals. Normalization will provide an update efficient data representation. Denormalization will\n                  make data reading efficient.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  In general, use normalized data models: when embedding would result in duplication of data but would not provide\n                  sufficient read performance advantages to outweigh the implications of the duplication. to represent more complex\n                  many-to-many relationships. to model large hierarchical data sets. Also normalizing your data like you would with a\n                  relational database is usually not a good idea in MongoDB.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  Normalization in relational databases is only feasible under the premise that JOINs between tables are relatively\n                  cheap. The $lookup aggregation operator provides some limited JOIN functionality, but it doesn't work with sharded\n                  collections. So joins often need to be emulated by the\n                  application through multiple subsequent database queries, which is very slow\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>18. What happens if an index does not fit into RAM?</h3>\n              <p>\n                If the indexes do not fit into RAM, MongoDB reads data from disk which is relatively very much slower than reading\n                from RAM.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>19. What are Primary and Secondary Replica sets?</h3>\n              <p>\n                Primary and master nodes are the nodes that can accept writes. MongoDB's replication is 'single-master:' only one\n                node can accept write operations at a time. Secondary and slave nodes are read-only nodes that replicate from the\n                primary.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>20. How does MongoDB provide concurrency?</h3>\n              <p>\n                MongoDB uses reader-writer locks that allow concurrent readers shared access to a resource, such as a database or\n                collection, but give exclusive access to a single write operation.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>21. MongoDB data types</h3>\n              <p>MongoDB supports many datatypes.Some of them are:</p>\n              <ul>\n                <li><b>String- </b>String in MongoDB must be UTF - 8 valid.</li>\n                <li><b>Integer- </b>Integer can be 32 bit or 64 bit depending upon our server.</li>\n                <li><b>Boolean Double- </b>Used to store floating point values.</li>\n                <li><b>Min/Max keys- </b>Compare a value against the lowest and highest BSON elements.</li>\n                <li><b>Arrays- </b>Used to store arrays or list or multiple values into one key.</li>\n                <li><b>Timestamp- </b>Can be handy for recording when a document has been modified or added.</li>\n                <li><b>Object- </b>Used for embedded documents.</li>\n                <li><b>Null- </b>Used to store a Null value.</li>\n                <li>\n                <b>Symbol- </b>This datatype is used identically to a string; however, it 's generally reserved for languages that use a\n                  specific symbol type.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  <b>Date- </b>This datatype is used to store the current date or time in UNIX time format.You can specify your own date time\n                  by creating object of Date and passing day, month, year into it.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li><b>Object ID- </b>This datatype is used to store the document's ID. </li>\n                <li><b>Binary data- </b>This datatype is used to store binary data. </li>\n                <li><b>Code- </b>This datatype is used to store JavaScript code into the document. </li>\n                <li><b>Regular expression- </b>This datatype is used to store regular expression.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>22.

Replication</h3>\n              <p>\n                Replication is the process of synchronizing data across multiple servers. Replication provides redundancy and\n                increases data availability with multiple copies of data on different database servers. \n              </p>\n              <b>Why Replication?</b>\n              <br />\n              <p>\n                To keep your data safe High (24*7) availability of data Disaster recovery No downtime for maintenance (like backups,\n                index rebuilds, compaction) Read scaling Replica set is transparent to the application.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <b>How Replication Works in MongoDB : </b><br />\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  MongoDB achieves replication by the use of replica set. A replica set is a group of mongod instances that host the\n                  same data set. In a replica, one node is primary node that receives all write operations. All other instances, such\n                  as secondaries, apply operations from the primary so that they have the same data set. Replica set can have only one\n                  primary node. Replica set is a group of two or more nodes (generally minimum 3 nodes are required).\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  In a replica set, one node is primary node and remaining nodes are secondary. At the time of automatic failover or\n                  maintenance, election establishes for primary and a new primary node is elected. After the recovery of failed node,\n                  it again join the replica set and works as a secondary node.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <b>Replica Set Features : </b>\n                <br />\n                <ul>\n                  <li>A cluster of N nodes </li>\n                  <li>Any one node can be primary</li>\n                  <li>All write operations go to primary</li>\n                  <li>Automatic failover </li>\n                  <li>Automatic recovery</li>\n                </ul>\n                <br />\n                <b>Consensus election of primary Set Up a Replica Set :</b>\n                <p>\n                  Sharding: Sharding is the process of storing data records across multiple machines and it is MongoDB's approach to\n                  meeting the demands of data growth. As the size of the data increases, a single machine may not be sufficient to\n                  store the data nor provide an acceptable read and write throughput.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Sharding solves the problem with horizontal scaling.

To limit this, you need to set a list of fields with value 1 or 0.\n                1 is used to show the field while 0 is used to hide the fields.\n              </p>\n\n              <h3>27. Creating a Capped Collection</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Capped collections are fixed-size circular collections that follow the insertion order to support high performance\n                  for create, read, and delete operations.</li>\n                <li>By circular, it means that when the fixed size allocated to the collection\n                  is exhausted, it will start deleting the oldest document in the collection without providing any explicit commands.\n                  Capped collections restrict updates to the documents if the update results in increased document size. Since capped\n                  collections store documents in the order of the disk storage, it ensures that the document size does not increase\n                  the size allocated on the disk. Capped collections are best for storing log information, cache data, or any other\n                  high volume data. </li>\n              </ul>\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={code}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <i>This will create a collection named student, with maximum size of 5 megabytes and maximum of 5000 documents.</i>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>28. What is mongodb indexing</h3>\n              MongoDB uses indexing in order to make the query processing more efficient. If there is no indexing, then the MongoDB must \n              scan every document in the collection and retrieve only those documents that match the query. Indexes are special data \n              structures that stores some information related to the documents such that it becomes easy for MongoDB to find the right data \n              file. The indexes are order by the value of the field specified in the index. \n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={createInd}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>29.

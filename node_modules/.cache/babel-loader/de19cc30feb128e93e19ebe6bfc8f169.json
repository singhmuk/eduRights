Let suppose we have three API urls as per first response, we need to call second and as per second response we need to call third API. if there would we error then on third api call we need to show the error, what would be the best approach for this. Can we use rxjs operator in this issue?\")))));\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default

This\n                  file will contain all the configurations of the app. While\n                  building the app, the builder looks at this file to find the\n                  entry point of the application. \n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  AppModule is getting bootstrapped. The AppModule is declared\n                  in the app.module.ts file. This module contains declarations\n                  of all the components.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>Now, AppComponent is getting bootstrapped.</li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  <b>Initialization: </b>When an Angular application is loaded\n                  in the browser, the main.ts file is executed, which\n                  initializes the application and bootstraps the root module.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  When an Angular application is launched, the main component is\n                  loaded, which in turn loads the other components and services\n                  that the application requires. The main component is typically\n                  called AppComponent and is defined in the app.component.ts\n                  file.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  Angular uses a reactive programming approach based on the\n                  Observable design pattern to handle events and data streams.\n                  This means that the application subscribes to data streams and\n                  reacts to changes as they occur, rather than polling for\n                  changes at regular intervals.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <b>index.html </b>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  The index.html file is the main entry point for an Angular\n                  application. When a user navigates to the URL of an Angular\n                  application, the web server serves the index.html file, which\n                  is loaded into the browser.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  The index.html file contains the necessary scripts and\n                  stylesheets that are required to load the Angular application\n                  into the browser. It also includes a 'base' tag, which is used\n                  by Angular's router to determine the base URL for the\n                  application.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  The main app component is usually loaded inside a 'div'\n                  element with an id of app-root in the index.html file. This\n                  component acts as the root of the application and is\n                  responsible for loading and rendering other components in the\n                  application.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  In addition to loading the Angular application, the index.html\n                  file can also be used to add any other necessary HTML, CSS, or\n                  JavaScript to the application, such as third-party libraries\n                  or custom stylesheets.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  Overall, the index.html file is an important part of an\n                  Angular application, as it serves as the entry point for the\n                  application and contains the necessary scripts and stylesheets\n                  to load the application into the browser.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <h3>\n                5.

Metadata in Angular is defined using\n                  decorators, which are special functions that modify the\n                  behavior of a class or component.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  During the build process, Angular's compiler analyzes the\n                  application's source code and generates an optimized version\n                  of the application's JavaScript code. As part of this process,\n                  the compiler can also modify the metadata associated with the\n                  application's components.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  Metadata rewriting is used to add or modify the metadata of a\n                  component, such as changing the selector, modifying the\n                  template or styles, or adding new input or output properties.\n                  This can be useful in situations where the component needs to\n                  be customized or extended for a specific use case.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  For example, suppose you have a third-party library that\n                  provides a component that you want to use in your Angular\n                  application. However, the component's selector conflicts with\n                  another component in your application, and you cannot change\n                  the selector of either component. In this case, you can use\n                  metadata rewriting to modify the selector of the third-party\n                  component during the build process, so that it does not\n                  conflict with the other component.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  Overall, metadata rewriting is a powerful feature of Angular\n                  that allows developers to modify the metadata associated with\n                  a component during the build process. This can be useful in a\n                  variety of situations, such as customizing third-party\n                  components, optimizing component performance, or adding new\n                  functionality to existing components.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <h3>13.

Let suppose we have a text field and that is name, and we\n                have to setup a validation to accept only 5 chars so how can we\n                achieve this by template driven forms. If we want to show the\n                error message then how can we do it.\n              </h3>\n              <br />\n              <h3>\n                23. Let suppose we have three API urls as per first response, we\n                need to call second and as per second response we need to call\n                third API. if there would we error then on third api call we\n                need to show the error, what would be the best approach for\n                this. Can we use rxjs operator in this issue?\n              </h3>\n            </List>\n          </Paper>\n        </Grid>\n      </Grid>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default withStyles(styles)(DepenInjection);\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}

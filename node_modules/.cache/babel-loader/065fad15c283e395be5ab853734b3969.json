Tell us about a recent project you worked on.</h3>\n            \"In my previous position, I had to create an online selling product for company to ensure \n            all clients can received a semiconductor product information and choose products on basis of \n            their requirments. \n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            At first, I struggled to incorporate content like the count, type and point-based features. \n            However, after researching similar programs, I used JavaScript to code an application where \n            we could upload company products and features for all clients. My implementations were \n            successful and helped the organisation eliminate lengthy processes.\"\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            \n            <h3>3. Which design patterns do you use most often?</h3>\n            \"For Zebra printer projects, I implement my printer state and client as singletons, and, for \n            printer creation, I use a factory to produce different printer based on inputs. However, if \n            more printer is required at a time, I may switch to using a compositional model, such as an \n            Entity-Component-System. The system functions would leverage dependency injection to better \n            separate concerns and increase the testability of the printer logic.\"\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            \n            <h3>4. How do you explain technical information to non-technical audiences?</h3>\n            If I work with someone without a technical background, I do my best to simplify my language \n            and reduce my communications to only what they need to know to understand my update or \n            question. \n            <br/>\n            For example, if I was describing a complicated coding process to a client, I might just describe the end-user changes and experience. This way, the information is more relatable.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            \n            <h3>5. Describe a difficult bug you fixed in a large application.</h3>\n            At my last job, my manager sent me a bug report about to create step function with pure \n            javaScript, the step function should collect data from database and on the basis of values \n            which getting from backend our UI step should be change. I develop UI but when receiving data\n            from API our required functionality didn't fulfilled.\n            I started by checking the logs to determine when the bug started, I used complex logic to achieved \n            our requirement.\n            From there, I was able to use the browser's developer tools to debug the issue.\n            </List>\n          </Paper>\n        </Grid>\n      </Grid>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default (withStyles(styles)(TechSkils));\n\n\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}

Hooks allow to easily manipulate the state of our functional component without convert \n              them into class components.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>Differences between a Class component and Functional component?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li><b>Class component: </b>\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>Uses ES6 class syntax.

The same \n              applies for ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason of passing props parameter to super() call is to access \n              <b>this.props</b> in your child constructors.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>Does React useState Hook update immediately?</h3>\n              React <b>useState and setState</b> don’t make changes directly to the state object; they create queues to optimize \n              performance, which is why the changes don’t update immediately. The process to update React state is asynchronous \n              for performance reasons.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>How can I make use of Error Boundaries in functional React components?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>As of v16.2.0, there's no way to turn a functional component into an error boundary. The \n                  <b>componentDidCatch()</b> method works like a JavaScript <b>catch block</b>, but for components. Only class \n                  components can be error boundaries. In practice, most of the time you’ll want to declare an error boundary \n                  component once and use it throughout your application.</li>\n                <li>Also bear in mind that <b>try/catch</b> blocks won't work on all cases. If a component deep in the hierarchy \n                tries to update and fails, the try/catch block in one of the parents won't work -- because it isn't necessarily \n                updating together with the child.</li>\n                <li>A few third party packages on npm implement error boundary hooks.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>What is prop drilling and how can you avoid it?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>When building a React application, there is often the need for a deeply nested component to use data provided \n                  by another component that is much higher in the hierarchy. The simplest approach is to simply pass a prop from \n                  each component to the next in the hierarchy from the source component to the deeply nested component. This is \n                  called prop drilling.</li><br/>\n                <li>The primary disadvantage of prop drilling is that components that should not otherwise be aware of the data \n                  become unnecessarily complicated and are harder to maintain.</li><br/>\n                <li>To avoid prop drilling, a common approach is to use React context. This allows a Provider component that \n                  supplies data to be defined, and allows nested components to consume context data via either a Consumer \n                  component or a useContext hook.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>What is StrictMode in React?</h3>\n              React's StrictMode is sort of a helper component that will help to write better react components, we can wrap a \n              set of components with <b>'StrictMode /'</b> and it'll basically:\n              <ul>\n                <li>Verify that the components inside are following some of the recommended practices and warn you if not in \n                  the console.</li>\n                <li>Verify the deprecated methods are not being used, and if they're used strict mode will warn you in the console.</li>\n                <li>Help you prevent some side effects by identifying potential risks.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>Why do class methods need to be bound to a class instance?</h3>\n              In JavaScript, the value of this changes depending on the current context. Within React class component methods, \n              developers normally expect this to refer to the current instance of a component, so it is necessary to bind these \n              methods to the instance. Normally this is done in the constructor.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>Why we should not update state directly?</h3>\n              If you try to update state directly then it won’t re-render the component.\n            </List>\n            <br/>\n\n            <h3>React application Bundling.</h3>\n            <b>What is a Bundle: </b>When it comes to modern web application development using React we all write JS code in a modular way for easy maintainability but when we are serving that code to a browser to parse it and render it we don’t have to worry about this and can serve all our code as a single JS file.\n            <br/>\n            This single JS file is called a bundle.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <b>How to create a JS Bundle: </b>Tools like Create React App internally use Webpack for bundling code.\n            <br/>\n            Bundlers like Webpack import all of our application’s dependencies and merge them into a single bundle.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <b>Advantages of bundling into a single file: </b>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Allowing the browser to download our entire application once and handle all the other navigations without any additional network calls to our server.</li>\n              <li>Browsers don’t need to load any other files because they are all in a single bundle.</li>\n              <li>While these advantages make bundling into a single file look very good, an application bundle can become very large as we add new features to our application, which means it can increase our application load time.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <br/>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Also keep in mind that our bundle size increases as you add new features to our application, This means that there can be an increase in our application’s load time.</li>\n              <li>The solution to the above problem is to split the bundle into smaller bundles, which ensures that browsers will only download the bundle they need for rendering only the page that the user visits. </li>\n              <li>By doing this, we will reduce the size of the bundle that the browser downloads during our application’s initial load and boost our application’s performance.</li>\n              <li>Bundle splitting allows us to delay loading the bundles until they are actually needed.</li>\n              <li>With <b>React.Lazy</b> we can load a component dynamically.</li>\n              <li>Unlike normal imports, which are synchronous, dynamic imports are asynchronous.

What is overfitting and underfitting ?</h1>\n              <ul>\n                <b>Overfitting:</b>\n                <li>Overfitting refers to the scenario where a ML model can’t generalize or\n                  fit well on unseen dataset. A clear sign of ML overfitting is if its error on the\n                  testing/ validation dataset is much greater than the error on training dataset.</li>\n                <li>Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training dataset to the\n                  extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on a new dataset. This means that\n                  the noise/ random fluctuations in the training dataset is picked up and learned as concepts by\n                  the model. The problem is that these concepts do not apply to new datasets and negatively impact\n                  the model’s ability to generalize.</li>\n                <br />\n\n                <b>Underfitting:</b>\n                <li>Underfitting refers to a model that can neither model the training dataset nor generalize to new\n                  dataset. An underfit ML model is not a suitable model and will be obvious as it will\n                  have poor performance on the training dataset.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <b>Example: </b>\n              Let’s three students have prepared for a mathematics examination.\n\n              The first student has only studied Addition mathematic operations and skipped other mathematics operations\n              such as Subtraction, Division, Multiplication etc.\n\n              The second student has a particularly good memory. Thus, second student has memorized all the problems presented\n              in the textbook.\n\n              And the third student has studied all mathematical operations and is well prepared for the exam.\n\n              In the exam student one will only be able to solve the questions related to Addition and will fail in problems or\n              questions asked related to other mathematics operations.\n\n              Student two will only be able to answer questions if they happened to appear in the textbook and will not be able\n              to answer any other questions.\n\n              Student three will be able to solve all the exam problems reasonably well.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              ML algorithms have similar behavior to our three students, sometimes the model generated by the\n              algorithm are similar to the first student. They learn from only from a small part of the training dataset, in\n              such cases the model is <b>Underfitting</b>.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              Sometimes the model will memorize the entire training dataset, like the second student. They perform very\n              well on known instances, but faulter badly on unseen data.

On speaking to friends, you later realize that\n              the taxi driver charged you twice/ three times more than the standard fare. This occurred as you were new in\n              the city and driver quite literally took you for a ride.\n\n              Also, you purchased some items from a street vendor, and you again ended up paying more than they were worth. You\n              finally decide that the people in the city “X” are dishonest. Which is a human trait, people often generalize.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              ML models also have this weakness if we are not careful to avoid bias during the development stages:\n              modeling, selecting algorithms, features, training dataset etc.\n              <br />\n              Suppose in the same city “X” another taxi driver charged you reasonably and as per the meter, but based\n              on experience, you consider that this driver has also charged more. This is called Overfitting.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              So can say that, if model performs well on test or unseen dataset then it is a\n              best fit/ good model. And if did not perform well on test or unseen dataset but did well on training\n              dataset then it is an Overfit model.

A\n                  replica set is a group of mongod instances that host the same\n                  data set. In a replica, one node is primary node that receives\n                  all write operations. All other instances, such as\n                  secondaries, apply operations from the primary so that they\n                  have the same data set. Replica set can have only one primary\n                  node. Replica set is a group of two or more nodes (generally\n                  minimum 3 nodes are required).\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  In a replica set, one node is primary node and remaining nodes\n                  are secondary. At the time of automatic failover or\n                  maintenance, election establishes for primary and a new\n                  primary node is elected. After the recovery of failed node, it\n                  again join the replica set and works as a secondary node.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <b>Replica Set Features : </b>\n                <br />\n                <ul>\n                  <li>A cluster of N nodes </li>\n                  <li>Any one node can be primary</li>\n                  <li>All write operations go to primary</li>\n                  <li>Automatic failover </li>\n                  <li>Automatic recovery</li>\n                </ul>\n                <br />\n                <b>Consensus election of primary Set Up a Replica Set :</b>\n                <p>\n                  Sharding: Sharding is the process of storing data records\n                  across multiple machines and it is MongoDB's approach to\n                  meeting the demands of data growth.

Capped collections restrict updates to the documents\n                  if the update results in increased document size. Since capped\n                  collections store documents in the order of the disk storage,\n                  it ensures that the document size does not increase the size\n                  allocated on the disk. Capped collections are best for storing\n                  log information, cache data, or any other high volume data.{\" \"}\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={code}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <i>\n                This will create a collection named student, with maximum size\n                of 5 megabytes and maximum of 5000 documents.\n              </i>\n              <br />\n              <h3>28.

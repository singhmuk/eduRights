If the value of the indexed field increments with every\n                insert, and most queries select recently added documents; then MongoDB only needs to keep the parts of the index that\n                hold the most recent or “right-most” values in RAM. This allows for efficient index use for read and write operations\n                and minimize the amount of RAM required to support the index.\n              </p>\n              <img src={Index} alt=\"Omega\" className=\"responsive\" style={redesign} />\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <br />\n\n              <b>Likes Comments</b>\n              <br />\n              <img src={mongoLikes} alt=\"Omega\" className=\"responsive\" style={redesign} />\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>4. How does MongoDB provide consistency?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  MongoDB uses the reader–writer locks, allowing simultaneous readers to access any supply like a database or a\n                  collection but always offering private access to single writes.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  MongoDB is consistent by default: reads and writes are issued to the primary member of a replica set. Applications\n                  can optionally read from secondary replicas, where data is eventually consistent by default.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  Eventual consistency means exactly that: the system is eventually consistent–if no updates are made to a given data\n                  item for a “long enough” period of time, sometime after hardware and network failures heal, then, eventually, all\n                  reads to that item will return the same consistent value.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>5. What is the use of Journaling in MongoDB?</h3>\n              <p>Journaling is used for safe backups in MongoDB.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>6. What is the use of Profiler?</h3>\n              <p>Profiler is used to show the performance characteristics of every operation against the database.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>7. What is Vertical Scaling?</h3>\n              <p>Vertical scaling adds more CPU and storage resources to increase capacity.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>8.Define Horizontal Scaling.</h3>\n              <p>Horizontal scaling divides the dataset and distributes data over multiple servers, or shards.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>9. What are the components of the Sharded cluster?</h3>\n              <p>The sharded cluster has the following components: </p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Shards</li>\n                <li>Query routers</li>\n                <li>Config servers</li>\n              </ul>\n\n              <h3>10. What is the use of the pretty() method?</h3>\n              <p>The pretty() method is used to show the results in a formatted way.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>11. What is the use of the dot notation in MongoDB?</h3>\n              <p>MongoDB uses the dot notation to access the elements of an array and the fields of an embedded document.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>12. What is Splitting in MongoDB?</h3>\n              <p>Splitting is a background process that is used to keep chunks from growing too large.</p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>13. What is the difference between MongoDB(non-relational) and MySQL(relational)?</h3>\n              <p>There is a lot of difference between them in:</p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Terms of data representation</li>\n                <li>Relationships</li>\n                <li>Transaction</li>\n                <li>Querying data</li>\n                <li>Schema design and definition</li>\n                <li>Performance</li>\n                <li>Speed</li>\n                <li>Normalization, and many more.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>14. Explain the structure of ObjectID in MongoDB.</h3>\n              <p>\n                ObjectIds are small, likely unique, fast to generate, and ordered. ObjectId values consist of 12 bytes, where the\n                first four bytes are a timestamp that reflect the ObjectId’s creation.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>15. Why MongoDB is not preferred over a 32-bit system?</h3>\n              <p>\n                When running a 32-bit build of MongoDB, the total storage size for the server, including data and indexes, is 2\n                gigabytes. For this reason, do not deploy MongoDB to production on 32-bit machines. If you're running a 64-bit build\n                of MongoDB, there's virtually no limit to storage size.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>16. Does MongoDB support ACID transaction management and locking functionalities?</h3>\n              <p>\n                Historically MongoDB does not support default multi-document ACID transactions (multiple-document updates that can be\n                rolled back and are ACID-compliant). However, MongoDB provides atomic operation on a single document.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>17. Should I normalize my data before storing it in MongoDB?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  It depends from your goals. Normalization will provide an update efficient data representation. Denormalization will\n                  make data reading efficient.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  In general, use embedded data models (denormalization) when: you have “contains”\n                  relationships between entities. you have one-to-many relationships between entities. In these relationships the\n                  “many” or child documents always appear with or are viewed in the context of the “one” or parent documents.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  In general, use normalized data models: when embedding would result in duplication of data but would not provide\n                  sufficient read performance advantages to outweigh the implications of the duplication. to represent more complex\n                  many-to-many relationships. to model large hierarchical data sets. Also normalizing your data like you would with a\n                  relational database is usually not a good idea in MongoDB.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  Normalization in relational databases is only feasible under the premise that JOINs between tables are relatively\n                  cheap. The $lookup aggregation operator provides some limited JOIN functionality, but it doesn't work with sharded\n                  collections. So joins often need to be emulated by the\n                  application through multiple subsequent database queries, which is very slow\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>18. What happens if an index does not fit into RAM?</h3>\n              <p>\n                If the indexes do not fit into RAM, MongoDB reads data from disk which is relatively very much slower than reading\n                from RAM.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>19. What are Primary and Secondary Replica sets?</h3>\n              <p>\n                Primary and master nodes are the nodes that can accept writes. MongoDB's replication is 'single-master:' only one\n                node can accept write operations at a time. Secondary and slave nodes are read-only nodes that replicate from the\n                primary.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>20.

Replication provides redundancy and\n                increases data availability with multiple copies of data on different database servers. Replication protects a\n                database from the loss of a single server.

A replica set is a group of mongod instances that host the\n                  same data set. In a replica, one node is primary node that receives all write operations. All other instances, such\n                  as secondaries, apply operations from the primary so that they have the same data set. Replica set can have only one\n                  primary node. Replica set is a group of two or more nodes (generally minimum 3 nodes are required).\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  In a replica set, one node is primary node and remaining nodes are secondary. At the time of automatic failover or\n                  maintenance, election establishes for primary and a new primary node is elected. After the recovery of failed node,\n                  it again join the replica set and works as a secondary node.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <b>Replica Set Features : </b>\n                <br />\n                <ul>\n                  <li>A cluster of N nodes </li>\n                  <li>Any one node can be primary</li>\n                  <li>All write operations go to primary</li>\n                  <li>Automatic failover </li>\n                  <li>Automatic recovery</li>\n                </ul>\n                <br />\n                <b>Consensus election of primary Set Up a Replica Set :</b>\n                <p>\n                  Sharding: Sharding is the process of storing data records across multiple machines and it is MongoDB's approach to\n                  meeting the demands of data growth. As the size of the data increases, a single machine may not be sufficient to\n                  store the data nor provide an acceptable read and write throughput.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Sharding solves the problem with horizontal scaling.

Since capped\n                  collections store documents in the order of the disk storage, it ensures that the document size does not increase\n                  the size allocated on the disk.

Don't make excuses. Make it a commitment as somebody said when you are interested in something. You do it when you like, When you are commited to something you do whether you like or you don't like. One traveler writes in his book, he was traveling in Africa and he came across a cannibal tribe. These cannibals, they eat humans. He was astonished that, one of the tribes men had been educated in America. He said after American english education. You still eat human flesh, then what is the difference. That cannibal said, \\\"The difference is earlier i used to eat it with my fingers, now i eat it with knife and fork\\\". That's not much of a difference, is it? What does it count for? It's so easy for our mond to make excuses. You know, I could not do it because the bord went over the head. There's an inspiring story about awareness from the japanese tradition. There has been a great sword fencer called Ram. His father was also a great sword fencer, but his father trained the other sons and he gave up on this guy that you are no good. Nevertheless, Ram went to another the greatest swordman of the land and he said, \\\"Will you teach me this?\\\" That master said, \\\"I will, but you will do exactly as i say, and you will not use your intellect.\\\" Ram said, \\\"All right.\\\" Start cleaning the vessels of the monastery. Ram Started cleaning the vessels. Then he had to cook, and then he had to clean the room, and get the water from the rivet. And this went on and on and on. One year went by, second year went by. He Started getting disappointed. There is no talking as well of the sword fencing i had come to learn it and there is no question about it. I only clean vessels and take care of the house. A third year went by. Finally, that master, he came from behind one day Ram was cleaning a vessel he wacked him. Ahh! He said, \\\"Be careful. Henceforth I can come and hit you at any time. He said all right. Now he Started developing his awareness and this master would come and whack him at any time. Slowly, slowly he Started getting more and more alert until he would be able to gaze and judge and dodge. Until his awareness developed even more when the merest whiff, and he would turn around and probably catch the stick or something. The master said, \\\"Now you are ready. Now i will teach you sword fencing.\\\" So it's a question of being completely aware. Don't make excuses. He is pretty stricy. He says irrespective of time, place, circumstance make it like a universal vow. Make it a commitment. When you are interested in something, You do it when you like. When you are commitment to something, you do it whether you like or you don't like. That's the kind of commitment he is demanding. Don't make compromises. This will require tremendous awareness. You know the opposite of awareness is carelessness. The devotees have their own way of being aware. Be aware of the presence of God. Maharajji says 'Be aware that God and Guru are with you and watching you all the time.' This kind of carelessness require a great motivation and a great dedication. You need to have complete lack of carelessness and complete application to the task. This will come, when you have a strong why. A strong reason motivating you. And the biggest reason motivating us is that the human form is a golden chance for the salvation of the soul. If we don't utilize it, we will go back. 'Aji sahab, you are a human being in this life what are you going to become in your next life?'. 'Ji, I am going to become a dhobi ka gadha.' My God! After the human being you're becoming a dhobi ka gadha? You've gone that down? Yes, I did not utilize the chance i had. The oppertunity is tremendous, but the time span is limited. And that time is slipping out of our hands. You know, like you lift up sand on the beach and you find it is slipping out until nothing is left so also is human life. We think I've got so many years, but without realizing it one by one the years go by. It was only a few years ago that you passed out of collage. It was only a few more years before that you enered school as a little child. How quickly the time has gone by. How quickly 2020 went by. Half of 2022 has also disappeared and it's never going to come back. Did we make the best use of it? One moment that we wasted is one moment lost forever. Mahatma said, What is the biggest loss in life? That moment which you don't utilize in remembering Shri Krishna. And why don't we utilize? Carelessness We know what we are supposed to do, but we don't do it because of carelessness. That carelessness makes us waste, squander the oppertunity. That is why to implement this we need to motivate ourselves. You see, when the motivation is there, the most challenging thing becomes easy and when the motivation is not there, the smallest difficulty seems like an unassailable wall. This motivation has to come, in other words, a deep hunger. Guru has said three special graces of God. The first is the human form. Everybody here has got that grace. The second is the guidance of the saints. That also we have got. The third is hunger. Hunger for the Ultimate Goal. You all have got it to a certain extent, that's why your have come here. But that one grace needs to be enhanced. In other word, the hunger has to be deepened. The deeper the hunger, the harder we shall endeavor the more careful we will be.\"))));\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default withStyles(styles)(ComSkils);","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/home/mukeshs/Projects/edurights/client/src/components/Redux/deep/comskills.js"],"names":["React","Component","Prism","Grid","Paper","withStyles","List","Sidebar","PrismCode","GitLogo","titles","backgroundColor","padding","fontSize","redesign","height","width","styles","theme","paper","margin","spacing","smMargin","actionDiv","textAlign","ComSkils","componentDidMount","setTimeout","highlightAll","render","classes","props"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,QAAiC,OAAjC;AACA,OAAOC,KAAP,MAAkB,SAAlB;AACA,SAASC,IAAT,EAAeC,KAAf,EAAsBC,UAAtB,EAAkCC,IAAlC,QAA8C,mBAA9C;AAEA,OAAO,0BAAP;AACA,OAAOC,OAAP,MAAoB,YAApB;AACA,OAAOC,SAAP,MAAsB,yBAAtB;AACA,OAAOC,OAAP,MAAoB,8BAApB;AAGA,MAAMC,MAAM,GAAG;AAAEC,EAAAA,eAAe,EAAE,SAAnB;AAA8BC,EAAAA,OAAO,EAAE,KAAvC;AAA8CC,EAAAA,QAAQ,EAAE;AAAxD,CAAf;AAEA,MAAMC,QAAQ,GAAG;AACfC,EAAAA,MAAM,EAAE,GADO;AAEfC,EAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAFQ,CAAjB;;AAKA,MAAMC,MAAM,GAAGC,KAAK,KAAK;AACvBC,EAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AACLC,IAAAA,MAAM,EAAEF,KAAK,CAACG,OAAN,CAAc,CAAd,CADH;AAELT,IAAAA,OAAO,EAAEM,KAAK,CAACG,OAAN,CAAc,CAAd;AAFJ,GADgB;AAKvBC,EAAAA,QAAQ,EAAE;AACRF,IAAAA,MAAM,EAAEF,KAAK,CAACG,OAAN,CAAc,CAAd;AADA,GALa;AAQvBE,EAAAA,SAAS,EAAE;AACTC,IAAAA,SAAS,EAAE;AADF;AARY,CAAL,CAApB;;AAeA,MAAMC,QAAN,SAAuBxB,SAAvB,CAAiC;AAC/ByB,EAAAA,iBAAiB,GAAG;AAClBC,IAAAA,UAAU,CAAC,MAAMzB,KAAK,CAAC0B,YAAN,EAAP,EAA6B,CAA7B,CAAV;AACD;;AACDC,EAAAA,MAAM,GAAG;AACP,UAAM;AAAEC,MAAAA;AAAF,QAAc,KAAKC,KAAzB;AACA,WACE,oBAAC,IAAD;AAAM,MAAA,SAAS,MAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE,oBAAC,IAAD;AAAM,MAAA,IAAI,MAAV;AAAW,MAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE,oBAAC,KAAD;AAAO,MAAA,SAAS,EAAED,OAAO,CAACX,KAA1B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OAAI,oBAAC,OAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,MAAJ,CADF,CADF,CADF,EAME,oBAAC,IAAD;AAAM,MAAA,IAAI,MAAV;AAAW,MAAA,EAAE,EAAE,EAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE,oBAAC,KAAD;AAAO,MAAA,SAAS,EAAEW,OAAO,CAACX,KAA1B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE,oBAAC,IAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,+DADF,k6KADF,CADF,CANF,CADF;AAsED;;AA5E8B;;AA+EjC,eAAgBd,UAAU,CAACY,MAAD,CAAV,CAAmBQ,QAAnB,CAAhB","sourcesContent":["import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Prism from \"prismjs\"\nimport { Grid, Paper, withStyles, List } from \"@material-ui/core\";\n\nimport '../../ReactJs/styles.css'\nimport Sidebar from '../sidebar';\nimport PrismCode from '../../ReactJs/prismCode';\nimport GitLogo from \"../../../assets/git_imgs.PNG\"\n\n\nconst titles = { backgroundColor: '#F0F8FF', padding: '1px', fontSize: '16px' }\n\nconst redesign = {\n  height: 350,\n  width: 600\n}\n\nconst styles = theme => ({\n  paper: {\n    margin: theme.spacing(1),\n    padding: theme.spacing(1)\n  },\n  smMargin: {\n    margin: theme.spacing(1)\n  },\n  actionDiv: {\n    textAlign: \"center\"\n  }\n})\n\n\n\nclass ComSkils extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    setTimeout(() => Prism.highlightAll(), 0)\n  }\n  render() {\n    const { classes } = this.props;\n    return (\n      <Grid container>\n        <Grid item xs={2}>\n          <Paper className={classes.paper}>\n            <h4><Sidebar /></h4>\n          </Paper>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid item xs={10}>\n          <Paper className={classes.paper}>\n            <List>\n              <h2>1. 3 things to remember to Stop Wasting Time in life.</h2>\n              don't compromise, The mond is expert in tricking us it will always create excuses one excuse\nwill lead to the other until we will hear it all ans still remain the same.

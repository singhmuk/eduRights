What does it mean for a component to be mounted in React?</h3>\n              It has a corresponding element created in the DOM and is connected to that.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>2. What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument in React?</h3>\n              A child class constructor cannot make use of this reference until super() method has been called. The same \n              applies for ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason of passing props parameter to super() call is to access \n              <b> this.props</b> in your child constructors.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>3. Does React useState Hook update immediately?</h3>\n              React <b>useState and setState</b> don’t make changes directly to the state object. they create queues to optimize \n              performance, which is why the changes don’t update immediately. The process to update React state is asynchronous \n              for performance reasons.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>4. How can I make use of Error Boundaries in functional React components?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>As of v16.2.0, there's no way to turn a functional component into an error boundary. The \n                  <b> componentDidCatch()</b> method works like a JavaScript <b>catch block</b>, but for components. Only class \n                  components can be error boundaries. In practice, most of the time you’ll want to declare an error boundary \n                  component once and use it throughout your application.</li>\n                <li>Also bear in mind that <b>try/catch</b> blocks won't work on all cases. If a component deep in the hierarchy \n                tries to update and fails, the try/catch block in one of the parents won't work -- because it isn't necessarily \n                updating together with the child.</li>\n                <li>A few third party packages on npm implement error boundary hooks.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>5. Why do class methods need to be bound to a class instance?</h3>\n              In JavaScript, the value of this changes depending on the current context. Within React class component methods, \n              developers normally expect this to refer to the current instance of a component, so it is necessary to bind these \n              methods to the instance. Normally this is done in the constructor.\n            \n            <br/>\n\n            <h3>6. React application Bundling.</h3>\n            <b>What is a Bundle: </b>When it comes to modern web application development using React we all write JS code in a \n            modular way for easy maintainability but when we are serving that code to a browser to parse it and render it we \n            don’t have to worry about this and can serve all our code as a single JS file.\n            <br/>\n            This single JS file is called a bundle.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <b>How to create a JS Bundle: </b>Tools like Create React App internally use Webpack for bundling code.\n            <br/>\n            Bundlers like Webpack import all of our application’s dependencies and merge them into a single bundle.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <b>Advantages of bundling into a single file: </b>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Allowing the browser to download our entire application once and handle all the other navigations without any \n                additional network calls to our server.</li>\n              <li>Browsers don’t need to load any other files because they are all in a single bundle.</li>\n              <li>While these advantages make bundling into a single file look very good, an application bundle can become very \n                large as we add new features to our application, which means it can increase our application load time.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <br/>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Also keep in mind that our bundle size increases as you add new features to our application, This means that \n                there can be an increase in our application’s load time.</li>\n              <li>The solution to the above problem is to split the bundle into smaller bundles, which ensures that browsers will \n                only download the bundle they need for rendering only the page that the user visits. </li>\n              <li>By doing this, we will reduce the size of the bundle that the browser downloads during our application’s initial \n                load and boost our application’s performance.</li>\n              <li>Bundle splitting allows us to delay loading the bundles until they are actually needed.</li>\n              <li>With <b>React.Lazy</b> we can load a component dynamically.</li>\n              <li>Unlike normal imports, which are synchronous, dynamic imports are asynchronous.

By default, our app is in development mode, which means React will include helpful warnings. \n              This can be very useful while we’re developing, but it can make our app size large and responses slower than usual. \n              If our project is built with create-react-app, we can fix this by running <b>npm run build</b> before deploying, \n              which will create a <b>production-ready</b> build of our app in a <b>build/ folder</b> that we can then deploy.</li>\n              <li>Use React.Suspense and React.Lazy for Lazy Loading Components.</li>\n              <li><b>React.memo for component memorization: </b></li>\n            </ul>\n            <br/>\n\n            <h3>8. How do you tell React to build in Production mode and what will that do?</h3>\n              There are many ways to produce a production build, so it really depends on how we created our project and the tools\n              we are using in it.\n              <ul>\n                <li>If we used create react app to develop our project, we will need to run `npm run build` or `yarn build`\n                  in the command line, on our project’s root folder. This will generate a “build” folder in our project, that has\n                  our entire app built ready for production.</li>\n                <li>If we set up our project manually, we should consult the bundler we are using. A common\n                  bundler is Webpack. If we used Webpack we can run `webpack` command in our command line. We\n                  may need to pass a different configuration to a production build. In that case we can tell Webpack\n                  what configuration to use when we run the `webpack` command.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n\n                  <b>For example: </b>`webpack —config config.prod.js`. The config has options for how to bundle\n                  things together, how to process our stylesheet, images, files, etc.., and where to save the\n                  production files. </li>\n              </ul>\n              <p>\n                Ordinarily you'd utilize Webpack's Define Plugin to set NODE_ENV to production. This will strip out things\n                like propType approval and additional notices. It's minify ouw code.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n\n            <h3>9.

React Children</h3>\n              <p>\n                In JSX expressions that contain both an opening tag and a closing tag, the content between those tags is passed to\n                components automatically as a special prop: props.children.

How to conditionally add attributes to React components?</h3>\n              For certain attributes, React is intelligent enough to omit the attribute if the value you pass to it is not truthy. \n              <br/>\n              <b>Ex. </b>\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={conditionally}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>18. How would you go about investigating slow React application rendering?</h3>\n              One of the most common issues in React applications is when components re-render unnecessarily. There are two \n              tools provided by React that are helpful in these situations:\n              <ul>\n                <li><b>React.memo(): </b>This prevents unnecessary re-rendering of function components.</li>\n                <li><b>PureComponent: </b>This prevents unnecessary re-rendering of class components</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br/>\n              Both of these tools rely on a shallow comparison of the props passed into the component—if the props have not \n              changed, then the component will not re-render. While both tools are very useful, the shallow comparison brings \n              with it an additional performance penalty, so both can have a negative performance impact if used incorrectly. \n              By using the React Profiler, performance can be measured before and after using these tools to ensure that \n              performance is actually improved by making a given change.\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>19.

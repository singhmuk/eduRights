If the value of the indexed field increments with every\n                insert, and most queries select recently added documents; then MongoDB only needs to keep the parts of the index that\n                hold the most recent or “right-most” values in RAM. This allows for efficient index use for read and write operations\n                and minimize the amount of RAM required to support the index.\n              </p>\n              <img src={Index} alt=\"Omega\" className=\"responsive\" style={redesign} />\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <br />\n\n              <b>Likes Comments</b>\n              <br />\n              <img src={mongoLikes} alt=\"Omega\" className=\"responsive\" style={redesign} />\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>4. How does MongoDB provide consistency?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  MongoDB uses the reader–writer locks, allowing simultaneous readers to access any supply like a database or a\n                  collection but always offering private access to single writes.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  MongoDB is consistent by default: reads and writes are issued to the primary member of a replica set. Applications\n                  can optionally read from secondary replicas, where data is eventually consistent by default.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  Eventual consistency means exactly that: the system is eventually consistent–if no updates are made to a given data\n                  item for a “long enough” period of time, sometime after hardware and network failures heal, then, eventually, all\n                  reads to that item will return the same consistent value.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>5.

Creating a Capped Collection</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Capped collections are fixed-size circular collections that follow the insertion order to support high performance\n                  for create, read, and delete operations.</li>\n                <li>By circular, it means that when the fixed size allocated to the collection\n                  is exhausted, it will start deleting the oldest document in the collection without providing any explicit commands.\n                  Capped collections restrict updates to the documents if the update results in increased document size. Since capped\n                  collections store documents in the order of the disk storage, it ensures that the document size does not increase\n                  the size allocated on the disk. Capped collections are best for storing log information, cache data, or any other\n                  high volume data. </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={code}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <i>This will create a collection named student, with maximum size of 5 megabytes and maximum of 5000 documents.</i>\n            </List>\n          </Paper>\n        </Grid>\n      </Grid>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default (withStyles(styles)(IntroMD));\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}

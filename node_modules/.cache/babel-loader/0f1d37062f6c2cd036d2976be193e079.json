What is the use of Bazel in Angular 8.</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>It provides a platform to make back-end and front-end services with the same tool.</li>\n                <li>It allows us to build CLI applications quickly and easily.</li>\n                <li>The entirety of the Angular framework is built on Bazel and it allows us to divide an\n                  application into various build units which are defined at the NgModule level.</li>\n                <li>It supports customization and also facilitates us to draw graphs. We can use these graphs to\n                  easily identify the essential information.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>12. Why we should use Bazel for Angular builds</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>The initial build time with Bazel will be comparable\n                  to the traditional JavaScript tooling. the difference is that the time will not grow exponentially when our\n                  application’s size increases. With Bazel most of the time the build time will stay constant.</li>\n                <li>Bazel rebuilds only the packages which have changed and nothing else.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>13. What is the use of Codelyzer</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>All enterprise applications follows a set of coding conventions and guidelines to maintain code\n                  in better way. Codelyzer is a tool to run and check whether the pre-defined coding guidelines has\n                  been followed or not.\n                  <br />\n                  Codelyzer does only static code analysis for angular and typescript project.</li>\n                <br />\n                <li>Codelyzer can be run via angular cli or npm directly.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>14. Why should ngOnInit be used, if we already have a constructor</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>The Constructor is a default method of the class that is executed when the class is instantiated\n                  and ensures proper initialization of fields in the class and its subclasses.</li>\n                <li>ngOnInit is a life cycle hook called by Angular to indicate that Angular is done creating the\n                  component.</li>\n                <li>We use ngOnInit for all the initialization/ declaration in the constructor. The constructor should only be used to\n                  initialize class members but shouldn't do actual \"work\". So you should use constructor() to setup Dependency Injection\n                  and not much else. ngOnInit() is better place to \"start\" - it's where/ when components' bindings are resolved.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>15. Are there any pros/ cons in using local storage to replace cookie functionality.</h3>\n              Cookies and local storage serve different purposes.\n              <ul>\n                <li>Cookies are primarily for reading server-side,</li>\n                <li>Local Storage can only be read by the client-side.</li>\n                <li>If data needs client, then by all means switch to local storage. You're wasting bandwidth by\n                  sending all the data in each HTTP header.</li>\n                <li>If data needs server, local storage is  okay if the server only needs\n                  a small subset of the total data for each request.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>16. Explain the purpose of Service Workers in Angular</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>A service worker is a script that runs in the web browser and manages caching for an application.</li>\n                <li>Angular service worker is designed to optimize the end user experience of using an application over a slow or\n                    unreliable network connection, while also minimizing the risks of serving outdated content.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>17. What are the design goals of service workers</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>It caches an application just like installing a native application.</li>\n                <li>A running application continues to run with the same version of all files without any incompatible files.</li>\n                <li>When you refresh the application, it loads the latest fully cached version.</li>\n                <li>When changes are published then it immediately updates in the background.</li>\n                <li>Service workers saves the bandwidth by downloading the resources only when they changed.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>18. Session Management</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Unlike cookies, the storage limit is larger<b>(5 mb)</b> and information is\n                  never transferred to the server.</li>\n                <li>Web storage<b>(localStorage and sessionStorage)</b> offer advantages compared to using cookies.\n                  Data is saved locally only and can't be read by the server, which eliminates the security\n                  issue that coockies present.</li>\n                <li>It allows for much more data to be saved<b>(10 mb for most browses)</b>.</li>\n                <li>It's simpler to use and the syntax is simple.</li>\n                <br />\n                <li>sessionStorage object is equal to the localStorage object, except that it stores the data for\n                  only one Session. The data is deleted when user close the browser tab.</li>\n                <br />\n                <li><b>'ng-container': </b>is a logical container that can be used to group nodes but it not rendered in\n                  the DOM tree as a node. 'ng-container' renderd as an HTML comment.</li>\n                <li>In order to avoid to create that extra div, use ng-container directive.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br/>\n\n              <h3>What is authentication and authorization in Angular.</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li><b>Authentication: </b>During login, the credential are sent to an authentication API. This API is present \n                on the server and validation is done there. After a JWT is returned, this token has information about the usr \n                and is used to identify the user.

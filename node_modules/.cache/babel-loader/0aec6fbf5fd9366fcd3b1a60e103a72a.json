Let suppose we have three API urls as per first response, we need to call second and as per second response we need to call third API. if there would we error then on third api call we need to show the error, what would be the best approach for this. Can we use rxjs operator in this issue?\")))));\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default

This\n                  file will contain all the configurations of the app. While\n                  building the app, the builder looks at this file to find the\n                  entry point of the application. \n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  AppModule is getting bootstrapped. The AppModule is declared\n                  in the app.module.ts file. This module contains declarations\n                  of all the components.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>Now, AppComponent is getting bootstrapped.</li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  <b>Initialization: </b>When an Angular application is loaded\n                  in the browser, the main.ts file is executed, which\n                  initializes the application and bootstraps the root module.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n\n                <li>\n                  When an Angular application is launched, the main component is\n                  loaded, which in turn loads the other components and services\n                  that the application requires. The main component is typically\n                  called AppComponent and is defined in the app.component.ts\n                  file.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  Angular uses a reactive programming approach based on the\n                  Observable design pattern to handle events and data streams.\n                  This means that the application subscribes to data streams and\n                  reacts to changes as they occur, rather than polling for\n                  changes at regular intervals.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <b>index.html </b>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  The index.html file is the main entry point for an Angular\n                  application. When a user navigates to the URL of an Angular\n                  application, the web server serves the index.html file, which\n                  is loaded into the browser.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  The index.html file contains the necessary scripts and\n                  stylesheets that are required to load the Angular application\n                  into the browser. It also includes a 'base' tag, which is used\n                  by Angular's router to determine the base URL for the\n                  application.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  The main app component is usually loaded inside a 'div'\n                  element with an id of app-root in the index.html file. This\n                  component acts as the root of the application and is\n                  responsible for loading and rendering other components in the\n                  application.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  In addition to loading the Angular application, the index.html\n                  file can also be used to add any other necessary HTML, CSS, or\n                  JavaScript to the application, such as third-party libraries\n                  or custom stylesheets.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  Overall, the index.html file is an important part of an\n                  Angular application, as it serves as the entry point for the\n                  application and contains the necessary scripts and stylesheets\n                  to load the application into the browser.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <h3>\n                5.

What are macros</h3>\n              The AOT compiler supports macros in the form of functions or\n              static methods that return an expression in a single return\n              expression.\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={macros}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <br />\n              <h3>\n                8. Can I use any javascript feature for expression syntax in AOT\n              </h3>\n              No, the AOT collector understands limited JavaScript features. If\n              an expression uses unsupported syntax, the collector writes an\n              error node to the .metadata.json file. Later point of time, the\n              compiler reports an error if it needs that piece of metadata to\n              generate the application code.\n              <br />\n              <h3>9. JIT compilation: </h3>\n              Just-in-Time is a type of compilation that compiles your app in\n              the browser at runtime. JIT compilation is the default when you\n              run the ng build (build only) or ng serve (build and serve\n              locally).\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  A JIT compiler runs after the program has started and compiles\n                  the code (usually bytecode or some kind of VM instructions). A\n                  JIT has access to dynamic runtime information whereas a\n                  standard compiler doesn't and can make better optimizations\n                  like inlining functions that are used frequently.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  This is in contrast to a traditional compiler that compiles\n                  all the code to machine language before the program is first\n                  run.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <h3>10. Ivy Compiler</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  Ivy is now default compiler and runtime. Ivy improves budle\n                  size, allows for better debugging, adds improves type\n                  checking, faster testing, enables the AOT compiler on by\n                  default, and improves CSS class and style binding.\n                </li>\n                <li>Reach better build times.</li>\n                <li>\n                  reach better build sizes (with a generated code more\n                  compatible with tree-shaking).\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  Unlock new potential features (metaprogramming or higher order\n                  components, lazy loading of component instead of modules).\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <h3>11. What is folding</h3>\n              The compiler can only resolve references to exported symbols in\n              the metadata. Whereas some of the non-exported members are folded\n              while generating the code.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              Folding is a process in which the collector evaluates an\n              expression during collection and record the result in the\n              .metadata.json instead of the original expression.\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={folding}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <br />\n              Remember that the compiler can’t fold everything. For example,\n              spread operator on arrays, objects created using new keywords and\n              function calls.\n              <br />\n              <h3>12. What is metadata rewriting</h3>\n              Metadata rewriting is the process in which the compiler converts\n              the expression initializing the fields such as useClass, useValue,\n              useFactory, and data into an exported variable, which replaces the\n              expression.\n              <br />\n              <h3>13. Explain the purpose of Service Workers in Angular</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  A service worker is a script that runs in the web browser and\n                  manages caching for an application.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  Angular service worker is designed to optimize the end user\n                  experience of using an application over a slow or unreliable\n                  network connection, while also minimizing the risks of serving\n                  outdated content.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <h3>14.

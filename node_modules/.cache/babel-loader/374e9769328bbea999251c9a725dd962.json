But the issue with that is load is not\n                    evenly distributed among all the processes.\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <h3>7. Node.js Process Model.</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  he Node.js process model is single-threaded, event-driven, and\n                  non-blocking, which means that a single thread can handle\n                  multiple requests at the same time. The Node.js runtime\n                  consists of a single thread, called the \"event loop\", which is\n                  responsible for managing all incoming events and executing\n                  callbacks.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  When a Node.js application is started, a process is created\n                  and the event loop begins running. As incoming events are\n                  received, they are placed in an event queue, and the event\n                  loop executes any callbacks associated with these events.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  Node.js uses an event-driven architecture to handle I/O\n                  operations. When an I/O operation is initiated, such as\n                  reading from a file or making a network request, Node.js\n                  registers a callback function to be executed when the\n                  operation completes. The event loop continues running while\n                  the I/O operation is in progress, allowing other events to be\n                  processed.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  Because Node.js is single-threaded, it can only handle one\n                  CPU-intensive task at a time. However, because I/O operations\n                  are non-blocking, the event loop can continue to process\n                  incoming events while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n                  This allows Node.js to handle a large number of concurrent\n                  connections efficiently.\n                </li>\n                <br />\n                <li>\n                  To take advantage of multiple CPU cores, Node.js provides a\n                  cluster module that allows a single Node.js process to spawn\n                  multiple worker processes. Each worker process runs in its own\n                  thread and can handle incoming requests independently. The\n                  master process manages the worker processes and distributes\n                  incoming requests among them.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <h3>8.

By using a single thread to handle all\n                    incoming requests, Node.js makes it easier for developers to\n                    write and maintain their code.\n                  </li>\n                  <br />\n                  <li>\n                    <b>Performance: </b>Node.js is built on top of Google's V8\n                    engine, which is designed to run JavaScript code very\n                    quickly. By using a single thread, Node.js can make better\n                    use of the available system resources, which can help to\n                    improve overall performance.\n                  </li>\n                  <br />\n                  <li>\n                    <b>Event-driven architecture: </b>Node.js uses an\n                    event-driven architecture to handle incoming requests. When\n                    a new request comes in, Node.js adds it to a queue and\n                    continues processing other requests. Once the request has\n                    been processed, Node.js sends a response back to the client.\n                    This approach allows Node.js to handle large numbers of\n                    requests without using a lot of resources.\n                  </li>\n                  <br />\n                  <li>\n                    <b>Asynchronous I/O: </b>Node.js uses asynchronous I/O to\n                    handle incoming requests.

Instead, it continues\n                    processing other requests while waiting for the I/O\n                    operation to complete. This approach allows Node.js to\n                    handle many concurrent connections without blocking the\n                    event loop.\n                  </li>\n                  <br />\n                  Overall, the single-threaded nature of Node.js allows it to be\n                  a lightweight, efficient, and easy-to-use platform for\n                  building scalable network applications.\n                </ul>\n              </p>\n              <b>Benefits of single threaded programming</b>\n              <ul>\n                It is very difficult to build high concurrency using the thread\n                model, especially models in which the state is shared.\n                Anticipating every way that an action taken in one thread might\n                affect all the others is nearly impossible once an application\n                grows.

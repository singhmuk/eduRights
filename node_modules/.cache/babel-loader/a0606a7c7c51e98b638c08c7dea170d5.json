With multiprocessing we can split the data into equal parts and do parallel computing on different CPUs.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <b>Ex. </b> Calculate the square numbers for all numbers from 1 to 1000000.

This means that the GIL allows only one thread to execute at a time even in a multi-threaded architecture.\n\n              <h3>Why is it needed?</h3>\n              It is needed because CPython's memory management is not thread-safe. Python uses reference counting for memory management. It means\n              that objects created in Python have a reference count variable that keeps track of the number of references that point to the object.\n              When this count reaches zero, the memory occupied by the object is released. The problem was that this reference count variable needed protection\n              from race conditions where two threads increase/ decrease its value simultaneously. If this happens, it can cause either leaked memory that\n              is never released or incorrectly release the memory while a reference to that object still exists.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>How to avoid the GIL</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Avoid GIL by using multiprocessing instead of threading. </li>\n                <li>Avoid the CPython implementation and use a free-threaded Python implementation like Jython or IronPython.</li>\n                <li>Move parts of the application out into binary extensions modules, i.e. use Python as a wrapper for\n                  third party libraries (e.g. in C/C++).

A race condition occurs when two/ more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same\n              time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, we don't know the order in which the threads will\n              attempt to access the shared data. In our case, the first thread accesses the database_value (0) and stores it in a local copy. It then\n              increments it (local_copy is now 1). With our time.sleep() function that just simulates some time consuming operations, the programm will swap\n              to the second thread in the meantime. This will also retrieve the current database_value (still 0) and increment the local_copy to 1. Now\n              both threads have a local copy with value 1, so both will write the 1 into the global database_value. This is why the end value is 1 and not 2.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <b>Avoid race conditions with Locks</b>\n              <br />\n              A lock (mutex) is a synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource in an environment where there are many\n              threads of execution.\n              <br />\n              <b>A Lock has two states: </b>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Locked</li>\n                <li>Unlocked</li>\n              </ul>\n              If the state is locked, it does not allow other concurrent threads to enter this code section until the state is unlocked again.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              Two functions are important:\n              <ul>\n                <li><b>lock.acquire():</b> This will lock the state and block</li>\n                <li><b>lock.release():</b> This will unlock the state again.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <br />\n              <b>N:</b> We should always release the block again after it was acquired!.\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>Using Queues in Python</h3>\n              Queues can be used for thread-safe/ process-safe data exchanges and data processing both in a multithreaded and a multiprocessing environment.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              <b>The queue</b>\n              <br />\n              A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle.\n              <div style={titles}>\n                <PrismCode\n                  code={waiting}\n                  language=\"js\"\n                  plugins={[\"line-numbers\"]}\n                />\n              </div>\n              <br />\n\n              <h3>Using a queue in multithreading</h3>\n              Operations with a queue are thread-safe.\n              <br />\n              <ul>\n                <li><b>q.get():</b> Remove and return the first item.
